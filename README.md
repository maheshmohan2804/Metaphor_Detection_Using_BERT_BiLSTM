# Metaphor Detection Using BERT Embedding and Bi-directional LSTM
In this notebook, we experiment with statistical models and deep learning models to help classify text into Metaphors and Non-Metaphors.
1) We use statistical models such as Logistic regression and XG boost for the task
2) We experiment with Bi-Directional LSTM as they are known to capture contextual understaanding effectively
3) We then experiment with BERT embeddings and combine it with Bi-Directional LSTM's
4) We observe that the effect of class imbalance and then later balance the data set with some examples
5) We repeaat 2 and 3 and observe the result
# Conclusion
Downstream tasks of BERT including embeddings can be very useful in tasks such as text classification. Here, we could observe significant improvement in accuracy, precision and recall.
