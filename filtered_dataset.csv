Hospital Course:

The 14-year-old male adolescent was admitted to the emergency department due to subfebrile temperatures and localized pain in his right popliteal fossa. Prior to these symptoms, the patient had been immobilized following a minor sports injury. The patient's medical history revealed an asymptomatic antithrombin deficiency (ATD) diagnosed 8 years ago and a maternal history of ATD. No other hereditary thrombophilic disorders were detected. The patient's blood analysis indicated elevated levels of D-dimers and C-reactive protein (CrP), and reduced antithrombin activity. The vascular ultrasound confirmed thrombosis of the right lower extremity. The patient received continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin followed by direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban. Empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results showed complete deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, and extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels. It also revealed occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with prominent venous lumbar collaterals suggestive of IVC associated with ATD. Catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was initiated in both extremities. Anticoagulative therapy was switched from argatroban to vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon. The patient was discharged on day eight after hospital admission.

A follow-up examination showed extended re-thrombosis of both pelvic axes and the right lower extremity, leading to a second hospital admission and re-induction of therapy. Recanalization of the right lower extremity and pelvic axis was subsequently achieved, but the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic. The patient's oral anticoagulation was intensified to prevent re-thrombosis. Regular follow-up examinations at the outpatient clinic did not give evidence for any new thrombotic events to date.

The patient was discharged on day seven after admission. The left iliac vessels remain thrombotic, but the IVC was successfully recanalized using balloon dilation and subsequent stenting. The patient’s mother was also found to have recanalized IVC upon angiography intervention.

Discharge Diagnosis:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, left lower extremity, both iliac vessels, and inferior vena cava (IVC) associated with antithrombin deficiency (ATD).

2. Recanalized IVC and thrombotic left iliac vessels.

3. IVCA.

Recommendations:

1. Oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon should be continued lifelong to prevent thrombosis due to the combination of extended multilocal thromboses with underlying ATD.

2. Follow-up examinations should be done regularly at the outpatient clinic.

3. The patient and their family should be counseled on the importance of continued medical management for ATD.

4. More interventions should be done for thrombotic lesions found in pelvic vessels.

This is a discharge summary for a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, essential hypertension, class 3 obesity, depression, and poor social and economic background. The patient was intermittently followed during the previous four years for persistent cutaneous candidiasis with intertrigo in the inframammary, inguinal, and lower abdominal regions. The patient was treated with topical antifungal, oral fluconazole and oral itraconazole with no improvement.

The patient presented with a worsening in the skin rash with exudate, pruritus, and a change to a violaceous colour, with scaly papules and vesicles. A skin biopsy showed orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis in the epidermis with areas of parakeratosis and, in the papillary dermis, there was an infiltrate of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and reniform nuclei that showed positive CD1a and S100 proteins on the immunohistochemistry and negative CD163.

After considering the skin histology, the extensive cutaneous involvement, and the infiltrative urothelial involvement, it was evident this was a multi-system process. A consultation with Hematology/Oncology, led to induction treatment with prednisolone and vinblastine-based chemotherapy. At six weeks of chemotherapy, there was a partial regression of the skin lesions and a resolution of the urothelium lesion in imaging exam.

The disease was in continuous regression and considering the extension of affected skin tissue a second round of chemotherapy with prednisolone and vinblastine was administered for six weeks. There was a resolution of all the lesions following this second round, and the patient underwent maintenance therapy consisting of administrating mercaptopurine daily and prednisolone/vinblastine every three weeks during 12 months, staying in remission.

Six months after the end of maintenance therapy the patient had a recurrence of the disease and started second-line chemotherapy with clofarabine and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). The patient did not comply with the treatment and the disease progressed. As a result of skin ulceration, she developed skin and soft tissue infection that evolved into septic shock and did not survive despite intensive care support.","What was the treatment plan for the patient's multi-system process, and how effective was it in achieving remission?","The patient's multi-system process was treated with induction treatment of prednisolone and vinblastine-based chemotherapy, resulting in partial regression of skin lesions and resolution of urothelium lesion in imaging exam at six weeks.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient, a 53-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, was admitted to our clinic due to the gradual worsening of his symptoms. He had a long history of atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, which was well-controlled with ACE inhibitors. He had been receiving oral anticoagulation therapy with dabigatran and antiarrhythmic therapy for the past few years, but his arrhythmic episodes persisted and required multiple admissions to the emergency room. After a thorough assessment, we proposed atrial fibrillation ablation to the patient.

PROCEDURE:
We performed bipolar mapping of the right atrium with the ThermoCool SmartTouch SF ablation catheter. The inferior and superior vena cava, and coronary sinus were delineated, and the His potential was tagged in yellow. The interatrial septum was carefully reconstructed, and the Fossa ovalis was precisely defined by setting the color range on the bipolar map to 0.25-0.75 mV and tagging all the fragmented and low voltage signals in light blue. The FO location was further confirmed by ICE and the CartoSound module. We also assessed and reconstructed the structures of the left atrium using ICE and the CartoSound module. A single transseptal puncture was performed using the VIZIGO sheath and transseptal needle. The ThermoCool SmartTouch SF catheter was advanced through the VIZIGO sheath into the left atrium to perform anatomical mapping and PVI, following the CLOSE protocol. Ablations were performed with good contact and stability, leading to fast and effective PVI. The entire procedure lasted 100 minutes, and there were no complications.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:
At discharge, the patient had no more symptoms and did not report any arrhythmic recurrences. He was not taking any antiarrhythmic drugs and was on apixaban 5mg twice daily and ACE inhibitor drug for blood pressure control.

FOLLOW-UP:
The patient was followed up 3 months after the procedure with an outpatient visit and electrocardiographic-Holter monitoring, which did not register any AF episode. After a 9 months follow-up, the patient presented no more symptoms, has not had any recurrences of AF, and was compliant with his medication.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and sleep apnea syndrome.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient was advised to continue with apixaban 5mg twice daily and ACE inhibitor drug for blood pressure control. He was advised to contact us if he experienced any new cardiac symptoms, such as palpitations or shortness of breath. The patient should also schedule a regular follow-up visit with his primary care physician to monitor his blood pressure and cardiac function.

History of Present Illness:
The patient presented with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in May 2019. Before starting the treatment, HBV serology revealed the presence of HBeAg and HBV DNA in serum. He was diagnosed with HBVr and started entecavir (ETV) treatment in July 2019. The therapy reduced viremia to a certain extent, but the decrease plateaued after 6 months. In January 2021, the patient switched to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), which resulted in a rapid decline of HBV DNA levels.

Past Medical History:
The patient received a kidney transplant for nephroangiosclerosis in August 2013, and he was included in the follow-up program as per protocol. The serologic screening for HBV pre-transplant showed that he was HBsAg-negative and anti-HBs-positive. He was positive for the HBeAg and antibodies to the HBeAg and to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). After the transplant, the patient received immunosuppressive induction as prescribed. The kidney donor was negative for HBV. The indices of hepatic cytolysis were normal throughout the follow-up program. The patient was diagnosed with HBVr in May 2019.

Assessment and Plan:
The case report revealed that the patient, despite having a high titer of HBV DNA in serum, was HBsAg-negative. The patient was diagnosed with HBVr and started ETV treatment, which initially reduced viremia but plateaued after 6 months. The patient switched to TAF treatment, which resulted in a rapid decline of HBV DNA levels. The patient had four mutations within the a-determinant and five additional mutations within the MHR. The patient was infected with HBV genotype D.

Follow-Up:
The patient underwent a close follow-up for the first 6 months of ETV treatment, followed by monthly scheduling thereafter. The patient started TAF treatment in January 2021, which resulted in a rapid decline of HBV DNA levels.

ADM: The patient was admitted to the pediatric cardiac surgery clinic with a confirmed diagnosis of CCL syndrome since birth. At the time of admission, she presented with cardiovascular symptoms including shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest pain.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a midline sternotomy procedure under general anesthesia. The procedure involved the resection of the thymus due to its enormous size and standard cannulation through the ascending aorta and superior and inferior vena cava. Cardioplegic arrest with full flow of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was induced for the patient. The surgical team examined the aortic valve and found some significant enlargement and dilatation of the leaflet; however, no intervention was performed as the valve was manually competent. The surgical team also identified significant enlargement of both atria, and as a result, resected right and left atrial appendages in combination with atrioplasty.

The surgical team opened the left atrium, examined the mitral valve, and found significant myxomatous changes of both anterior and posterior leaflets. The valve was deemed irreparable, and the decision was made intraoperatively to replace the mitral valve with a 33-mm St. Jude Medical Epic porcine valve prosthesis. After this, the team performed commissural tricuspid annuloplasty on the tricuspid valve which rendered it competent. The patient was fully rewarmed and weaned off CPB with trace tricuspid regurgitation observed on intraoperative TEE.

POST-PROCEDURE: The patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) and monitored for stability. During the first 15 hours in the CSICU, the chest tubes drained blood with a total of 1,450 mL (right lower pleura), 300 mL (mediastinum), and 1,330 mL (left lower pleura). The bleeding was controlled after the patient received five units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), seven units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), two units of cryoprecipitated antihemophilic factor (Cryo), two units of platelets, and two doses of intravenous protamine sulfate (50 mg per dose). The patient was subsequently shifted from the CSICU to the ward on postoperative day 3 (POD 3) and monitored for normal lab values.

DISCHARGE CONDITION: The patient's chest drains were removed subsequently, and she was able to resume normal activity. Predischarge transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no significant changes, and the patient was deemed satisfactory for discharge. The patient was discharged home on POD 6 and advised to follow the prescribed postoperative care plan. She was provided with instructions for taking care of any wounds and incisions that need monitoring. Additionally, the patient was advised to contact the clinic immediately if she experiences any sudden worsening of symptoms that require medical attention.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: Mitral and tricuspid valve replacement with a 33-mm St. Jude Medical Epic porcine valve prosthesis and commissural tricuspid annuloplasty performed for CCL syndrome.

Medical History:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a medical history significant for hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent liver transplantation from a living donor.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for severe acute pancreatitis with severe abdominal pain. Continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day was started to control abdominal pain. The fentanyl dose was increased according to pain intensity, reaching 2400 μg/day (MED 240 mg/day) after 10 days in the hospital. Administration of a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid alleviated the pancreatitis and abdominal pain.

The patient subsequently developed nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation of continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion. Continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion of 240 μg/day was resumed, and these symptoms disappeared.

The patient was then switched to a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. Pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later, and therefore, continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion was resumed, titrated to 600 μg/day. The dose was gradually decreased daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day).

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a history of univentricular heart with tricuspid atresia. The patient was admitted for Fontan conversion surgery due to serious right atriomegaly with frequent episodes of atrial tachycardia.

Hospital Course:
The patient successfully underwent Fontan conversion surgery, but unfortunately suffered from severe single ventricle dysfunction resulting in low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS). The patient was implanted with an ECMO device, but could not be weaned off due to multi-organ failure and eventually passed away.

Pertinent Findings:
The pre-operative ventricular function was mildly reduced (50%). Seven patients required pace-maker implantation due to post-operative sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. At the time of discharge, 15 patients had sinus rhythm, 5 had a stable pacemaker rhythm, 2 had atrial fibrillation, and 1 had atrial flutter. One patient was discharged in sinus rhythm but had a pacemaker implant five months after the operation due to sinus node dysfunction. During the follow-up period of 14 months (IQR 7–27), 2/23 patients experienced a recurrence of arrhythmia more than three months after surgery.

Outcome:
During the follow-up period of 14 months (IQR 7–27), there were no cases of late mortality. 17/23 patients had an improvement in their NYHA functional class. Five patients in NYHA III progressed to class II and 4 to class I. Eight patients progressed from class II to class I.

Admission Diagnosis:

Severe postburn mentosternal contracture and cicatricial carcinoma.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for skin grafting surgery due to a severe burn that occurred when she was four years old. She had undergone two reconstructive procedures in local medical centers at the ages of seven and 14. The patient presented with severe scar contractures and a large tumor of approximately 15 × 12 cm on the lower lip, neck, and anterior chest. In addition, the patient had limited mouth opening (15 mm) and Mallampati test could not be performed. The patient had tried several medical centers for treatment in the past year, but had failed for unsuccessful airway topicalization and intubation (ATI). Due to the pain caused by the occurrence of cicatricial carcinoma, affecting eating and speaking, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and management.

During the preoperative physical examination, the patient's chin, chest, and bilateral armpits fused together; the cervicomental and mentosternal angles were completely obliterated; the anterior neck structures, including the larynx, the trachea, and the carotid arteries, were unidentifiable or impalpable. The left nostril was obstructive for stenosis, but the right nostril breathing was smooth. Preoperative X-rays and a computed tomography scan revealed distortion of the upper airway and no stenosis of the trachea. Face mask ventilation could not be performed due to the nearly fixed neck and regressed mandible. According to guidelines on the management of difficult airway, an awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation with topicalization was considered the preferred approach; however, the patient rejected ATI for discomfort and nociceptive recall before. Other awake strategies, including lightwand, GlideScopeⓇ Video laryngoscope, laryngeal mask airway, oral or nasal blind intubation, retrograde intubation, surgical tracheostomy, seemed impossible. Therefore, a flexible bronchoscopic intubation protocol under precise sedation, topicalization, and spontaneous respiration preservation was scheduled.

After obtaining a written informed consent with explanation focused on the risks of difficult airway and intramuscular injection of Atropine 0.5 mg to reduce secretion 30 minutes before transferring to the operating room, the patient was monitored for respiration rate, ventilation volume, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, blood pressure and bispectral index (BIS). Preoxygenation was performed once the patient arrived in the operating room and intravenous midazolam 2 mg and sufentanil 5 μg were administered. Nasal passage was anesthetized by pledgets with 2% lidocaine and 0.25% phenylephrine. Sevoflurane 2% with a flow rate of 4 L/min with 100% O2 was administered via an endoscopic mask connected to the ventilator circuit. The concentration of sevoflurane was gradually increased to 4% and stopped when the BIS reached 55-60 within 3 minutes, then airway reassessment and precise topicalization were achieved by a modified SAYGO technique.

An epidural catheter, with an outer diameter of 3.8 mm and 1.5 cm longer, was fixed to the fiberscope (MDH A10; Zhuhai Mindhao Medical Technology Co., Ltd., ShenZhen, China). Topicalization was achieved by spraying 2% lidocaine (7 ml) via the catheter onto the posterior nasal canal, pharyngeal cavity, epiglottis, glottis, and tracheal.

Emergent admission of a 34-year-old female patient with an intense, periumbilical, and pelvic abdominal pain associated with acute vomiting was presented to our emergency room. The clinical examination revealed a painful mass that was irreducible and impulsive in nature at the umbilical level. An abdominal ultrasound scan showed that the patient was suffering from an evolving mono-fetal pregnancy estimated at 1 kg which was strangulated through an umbilical orifice.

Given this unexpected diagnosis, a multi-disciplinary team recommended an MRI was performed, without injection because of the teratogenic nature of the test. Our radiological assessment showed a strangulation of the pregnant uterus through an orifice of 6 cm, which resulted in a strangulated hernia of a pregnant uterus at the umbilical level with the right ovary, though there was no visible intestinal loop. After discussion with the patient, a multidisciplinary team recommended moving forward with a ceolioscopic exploration under general anesthesia. The procedure went smoothly, and the gravid uterus and right ovary were safely reduced using a careful dissection of the hernia sac and external manual assistance. 

Before the intraperitoneal plate was placed, an obstetrical ultrasound scan confirmed that there was a viable and evolving pregnancy. The patient's postoperative evolution was favorable, and she was discharged two days after the operation. During the two-year follow-up, there was no recurrence of the condition. 

The patient opted for tubal ligation and was scheduled for a cesarean section at the end of the pregnancy. With the assistance of our team, the patient gave birth to a 2.5 kg male infant with good psychomotor development. Further evaluation was not warranted, and the patient did not experience any adverse postoperative complications.

Hospital Course:
[Patient's Name], an 83-year-old Japanese woman, was admitted to our department with a chief complaint of a mass in her right maxillary premolar region. The patient had initially noticed a painless mass in her right maxillary premolar region in 2002, but she did not seek any treatment for it. She was referred to us for examination and treatment due to difficulty in performing tracheal intubation for surgery of sigmoid colon cancer at another hospital.

After performing several tests, the patient was diagnosed with peripheral ossifying fibroma with squamous cell carcinoma. We suspected a benign gingival tumor in the right maxillary premolar region, which was confirmed by a biopsy. Later, tumorectomy was performed under general anesthesia to remove the tumor, including the surrounding tissue. One week after surgery, the wound was covered with an oral appliance for protection.

The microscopic findings of the surgically removed tumor were similar to those of the biopsy specimen. The tumor was composed of spindle-shaped cells that were proliferating with collagenous fiber, and scattered bone formation was also observed. The epithelial component of the tumor was considered to be well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. No signs of local recurrence or metastasis have been observed during follow-up.

Patient History:
The patient's history included sigmoid colon cancer, subarachnoid hemorrhaging, bronchitic asthma, and cardiac insufficiency.

Physical Exam:
Regarding the intra- and extra-oral findings, a massive pedunculated mass in the right maxillary premolar region measuring 83 × 58 × 35 mm was palpable. Furthermore, it covered the front of the right palate, and it protruded to the extra-oral region from the right maxillary premolar alveolar region. Its surface was almost entirely smooth, and some erosions and ulcerations were seen. It was elastic and hard and showed no tenderness on palpation. There was no palpable regional lymphadenopathy.

Diagnosis:
Peripheral ossifying fibroma with squamous cell carcinoma (pT1N0M0)

Treatment:
Tumorectomy was performed under general anesthesia to remove the tumor, including the surrounding tissue. One week after surgery, the wound was covered with an oral appliance for protection.

Age: 25 years old
Medical Record Number: Confidential

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital for infertility lasting over a year. A physical examination was conducted and was found to be normal, but computed tomodensitometry (CT) revealed a cyst in the left ovary along with abundant peritoneal ascites indicating mucinous material. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of ascites and revealed a heterogeneous mass in the left ovary with adipose, solid, and cystic regions similar to a dermoid cyst. The patient underwent surgical intervention by left oophorectomy with appendicectomy and omentectomy without the need for additional hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) three months after her initial consultation, without complication. The follow-up based on clinical and imaging surveillance revealed no complaints, and the patient was able to pursue her plan of having a child.

Medical History:
The patient had no previous medical history.

Diagnosis:
The histological analysis indicated that the ovarian cyst corresponded to a mature pluritissular teratoma with intermingled skin and pilosebaceous annexes, serous and mucinous glands, respiratory epithelium, adipose tissue, and smooth muscle. A thick muscularis propria was also observed. The area that represented around 20% of the ovarian cyst had the appearance of a colon, comprising colonic mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis mucosae, to the depth. Further pathological studies suggested that the patient was suffering from acellular PMP caused by a ruptured appendiceal-like mucocele accompanied by LAMN, in a left ovarian teratoma.

Treatment:
The patient underwent surgery by left oophorectomy with appendicectomy and omentectomy.

The patient, a 19-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital due to severe excretory kidney function decline. Upon physical examination, he presented with dyspnea, lack of appetite, moderate itchiness, and an overall reduced physical condition. He reported a upper respiratory tract infection with persistent fatigue, and experienced pain in his right eye accompanied by redness and blurred vision. An ophthalmological examination led to the diagnosis of anterior uveitis. The initial laboratory tests indicated impaired kidney function and mildly increased parathormone (PTH), C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin, and total serum immunoglobulin-G (IgG). Immune diagnostics revealed positive findings for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) titer and anti-La. The patient was diagnosed with tubulointerstitial nephritis with anterior uveitis (TINU) syndrome of no specific or suspected origin.
 
Course in the Hospital:
Upon admission, the patient was started on intravenous glucocorticoids (prednisolone) for three consecutive days, followed by oral prednisolone, and placed on renal replacement therapy (RRT, hemodialysis). The course was complicated by a fever and general weakness that required transfer to the local intensive care unit (ICU). Once in the ICU, a central vein catheter was removed due to localized pain around the insertion area. The patient was continued on oral prednisolone therapy and received intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin and tazobactam) and was subsequently transferred out of the ICU to the general ward. RRT was continued with the establishment of a new central vein catheter.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Age: 61
Gender: Male

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital due to hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor of approximately 5 cm diameter at the liver segment IV. The patient underwent partial hepatectomy with segments IV + V and cholecystectomy with cystic duct-tube drainage. During the postoperative day 1, bile drainage was observed from the drain placed in the foramen of Winslow. Fluid collection between the liver and fistula was found through a CT scan. The patient was put under simple drainage to reduce the cavity.

On postoperative day 19, the patient experienced fever and a CT scan revealed an increase in fluid collection. Percutaneous drainage was performed to the cavity near the liver cut surface. The patient was diagnosed with bile leakage from the isolated bile duct of segments V and VIII. Functional remnant liver volume was calculated, which was found to be sufficient for bile leakage management.

The therapeutic strategy involved a combination of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography drainage (PTCD) tube insertion, percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization (PTPE), and bile duct ablation. PTPE with coil embolization was performed to the part of the portal vein of segments V and VIII by puncturing the part of the portal vein of segment V. Bile leakage decreased to about 50 mL/day. An injection of 1.2 mL pure ethanol was made, which leaked into the abdominal cavity. The PTCD tubes were clamped for 5 min. Another bile duct ablation with 2.0 mL of pure ethanol was performed 1 week after the first procedure. Bile leakage decreased from 50 to 10 mL/day gradually. The patient was reinjected with 2.0 mL of pure ethanol for three times.

The patient was discharged after 139 postoperative days. The drainage tube and bile duct tube were removed. The clinical course was uneventful, and no complications were noted during the combination treatment of PTPE and bile duct ablation.

Diagnosis:

The patient had hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor of approximately 5 cm diameter at the liver segment IV. The patient had a history of excessive alcohol consumption.

Medical Report:
The patient was admitted with multiple hepatic tumors, including a giant tumor, superior to the inferior vena cava. A laboratory workup on admission showed mildly increased concentrations of liver enzymes but normal levels of total bilirubin and albumin. Imaging studies revealed well-defined, hypoechoic masses in segment 1, S6, and S2 of the liver. Dynamic CT showed a low-density mass with an irregular margin and peripheral early ring enhancement in the arterial phase and internal heterogeneous enhancement in the delayed phase. MRI showed low-intensity signals on T1-weighted images and high-intensity signals on T2-weighted images. On the basis of these imaging findings, a preoperative diagnosis of multiple scirrhous hepatocellular carcinomas characterized by abundant fibrous stroma was made. However, after a histopathological examination, the tumor was found to be hepatic sclerosing hemangioma, a rare type of hepatic hemangioma composed of abundant acellular hyalinized tissue with small vessels seen occasionally.

The patient, a 79-year-old woman, was admitted for evaluation of abnormal murmur. She presented with a 3-months history of worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea. Physical examination revealed a soft continuous murmur at the left upper chest with basal crackles in both lungs. Chest radiography showed mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary congestion. The ECG showed regular sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia or prior myocardial infarction.
Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a mildly dilated LV with markedly dilated left atrium. The LV ejection fraction was 60% with no wall motion abnormality. Transthoracic echocardiography also showed an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent, predominantly diastolic flow on color Doppler. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a markedly dilated RCA arising from the right aortic sinus, while the origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) could not be demonstrated. There was a tortuous, abnormal vessel located adjacent to the main pulmonary artery (MPA) emptying into the posteromedial aspect of the MPA. There was an accelerated, continuous flow across the stenotic ostium. Moreover, there was severe MR from a restricted posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (MV) associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation.
Coronary angiography with a single RCA injection revealed a markedly dilated RCA providing multiple intercoronary collaterals of various sizes communicating with the left coronary system. The LCA later opacified the MPA through a stenotic ostium, establishing the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome. The calculated ratio of pulmonary-systemic blood flow was 1.4, confirming a significant left-to-right shunt. Coronary computed tomography angiography clearly identified the ALCAPA with a retropulmonary ostium. Volume-rendered image depicted the course of the anomalous coronary arteries and its inter-coronary collateral pathways along the epicardial surface and where the LCA connected to the MPA. Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance perfusion imaging demonstrated no myocardial ischemia, suggesting adequate collateral circulation to the LV.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a suspected tumor in her pelvis. An MRI examination revealed mobility of the tumor, which led to further investigations. A mass-sized 45 mm on the right side of the pelvic floor was found through a contrast CT image. The tumor was nourished by vessels from the splenic artery to the greater omentum. Based on the diagnostic tests and imaging findings, a preoperative diagnosis of a suspected omental primary tumor or accessory spleen was made. The patient underwent a single-incision laparoscopic-assisted greater omental tumor resection, a surgery to remove the tumor, to prevent torsion and to diagnose and treat the tumor concurrently. The greater omentum and the tumor were removed without any complications.

Diagnosis:
The histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of an omental PEComa, a tumor involving large and small blood vessels. These tumors are rare and originate from perivascular epithelioid cells.

Treatment and Follow-up Plans:
The patient did not face any complications post-surgery, and she underwent a smooth recovery. She was discharged without further complications after the surgery. The patient underwent follow-up at regular intervals, and there has been no recurrence of the tumor observed after 16 months since the surgery.

Patient: 25-year-old male

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to our Oral Surgery Clinic with recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek. He had previously undergone bimaxillary orthognathic surgery in a local hospital. During the operation, an orthodontic appliance was dislodged into his right cheek, which was found during the postoperative period. The appliance was left in-situ with continuous clinical observation due to the absence of sign and symptoms during further follow-up sessions.
After undergoing examination and radiography, a sinus track was found which was suspected to originate from the dislodged orthodontic appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue. After further investigation through exploration of the site under general anesthesia, the dislodged molar tube was identified lying on the zygomatic bone just beneath the raised flap, which was removed by dividing some surrounding fibrous tissue strands. A titanium straight bone plate with four screws used for fixing the previous Le Fort I osteotomy site was found to be rigidly embedded in normal bone below the removed appliance. Due to the site being infected, the plate and screws were removed.
The patient had an uneventful recovery and was informed of his progress.

Final Diagnosis:
Dislodged orthodontic appliance in right cheek with associated foreign body reaction and infection.

Patient Name: Confidential
Admission Date: XX/XX/XXXX
Discharge Date: XX/XX/XXXX

History of Presenting Illness:
The patient, a 27-year-old woman, was admitted with a one-month history of facial edema, weight loss, and acne. She had previously sought medical attention at a local hospital for facial redness and edema caused by eating a mango, and was treated with dexamethasone for five days. The patient gradually developed severe facial edema, beard, central deposition of fat with slim extremities and atrophic muscles, and no pretibial edema over the course of one month. 

Medical History:
The patient had a history of a 5.5-cm mass located in the right posterior lobe of the liver detected by ultrasound in a routine physical examination 16 months ago at a local hospital. However, the patient did not experience any symptoms at that time.

Physical Examination:
Upon hospitalization, the patient was found to have “moon face” and severe facial edema, beard, central deposition of fat with slim extremities and atrophic muscles, and no pretibial edema. The skin was diffused with acne, and both armpits had hyperpigmentation.

Diagnostic Findings:
Laboratory tests revealed that the patient had marked hypokalemia, which did not normalize with oral and intravenous potassium supplementation until spironolactone was added. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test confirmed diabetes mellitus. Endocrinological investigation identified severe hypercortisolism with loss of circadian rhythm, and plasma ACTH level was elevated to 1157 pg/mL, confirming ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome. MRI and contrasted MRI revealed no pituitary adenoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scanning revealed that the mass lesion was located in the right adrenal gland and not in the right hepatic posterior lobe. PET/CT showed moderate fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the mass.

Treatment:
Adrenal tumorectomy was performed, and no hypertensive crisis occurred during surgery. A 6.5-cm black mass was found arising from the medial branch of the right adrenal gland. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the tumor revealed that most of the cells were chromaffin-like cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor showed positive staining for chromogranin A (CgA) and CD56, with a Ki67 labeling index of approximately 16% for chromaffin-like cells. ACTH levels decreased from 715 to 14.3 pg/ml one day after surgery, and serum cortisol levels decreased from more than 50 to 10.4 μg/dl. The patient's signs and symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome gradually disappeared within two months, and the hydrocortisone supplementation was discontinued seven weeks postoperatively. CT revealed that the left adrenal gland was almost reduced to the normal size three months later.

This is a 26-year-old prelingually Deaf male with a prior history of Tourette's syndrome, bipolar disorder, and HIV. The patient was placed under Baker Act at a local hospital for “acting erratic and psychotic.” Upon initial evaluation, the preliminary diagnosis was “psychosis.”

Hospital Course:

Upon admission, an ASL-interpreter was called to assist. The patient became angry after discovering the truth of his hospitalization. Later, the patient reported having anxiety and physical pain attributed to his Tourette's Disorder. He had been taking carisoprodol and diazepam to help relieve his symptoms, but they were recently stopped. The family was called and stated there was questionable abuse of medications but they were adamant that he was safe for himself and others. 

Further interview excluded OCD as a diagnosis but substance use disorder remained high on the differential for his current and past behavior. The patient admitted to buying oxycodone off the street since his neurologist stopped prescribing medications due to questionable abuse. A clinical opiate withdrawal scale was performed and was only positive for minor anxiety elevation. A full medical workup was performed and excluded any medical causes to his admission.

The patient was kept for observation and discharged the next morning following positive report from staff. He was given extensive education on substance use as well as coping strategies to prevent readmissions. Upon discharge “unspecified psychosis” was given as his diagnosis.

The patient, a 72-year-old male, presented at the hospital with a change of personality and weight loss. Cranial MRI revealed a large low contrast-enhancing mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere. The tumor caused occlusive hydrocephalus but no surrounding edema. The suspected diagnoses were metastasis without presence of any neoplasm in the patient history or medulloblastoma (MB). The possibility of a high-grade glioma was discussed but neglected due to its rare occurrence in the cerebellum of this age group. Prior to surgery, an external ventricular drainage was inserted, and complete tumor resection was performed. Histopathological examination showed a highly cellular cerebellar tumor, which was diagnosed as a classical MB (WHO grade IV) with no nodular or desmoplastic component.

Hospital Course:

The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian man with a history of schizophrenia who was admitted to our facility with catatonia and altered mental status. The patient had been transferred to our facility from a psychiatric hospital where he was on high-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as fluphenazine and haloperidol, which had worsened his agitation and behavioural dysregulation. He had subsequently been started on chlorpromazine prior to transfer to our facility.

Upon arrival at our facility, the patient was started on standard treatment, which involved discontinuation of antipsychotics and initiation of parenteral benzodiazepines such as lorazepam. During the hospital course, the patient exhibited fluctuating motor symptoms, which were accompanied by autonomic hyperactivity, diaphoresis, and droning vocalizations. The patient was also noted to have severe rigidity in both upper and lower extremities, waxy flexibility, posturing, negativism, automatic obedience, and the presence of mitgehen. An electroencephalogram performed during the hospitalization was notable only for increased beta waves, reflecting the high-dose benzodiazepines the patient was receiving at the time.

After the patient received three sessions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) without complications, his condition improved, and he was started on amantadine, which helped to manage his motor symptoms. The patient's urinary tract infection was also treated with antibiotics during the hospitalization, which resolved delirium.

Towards the end of the hospitalization, the patient was gradually lysed of catatonia and normalized lab values. The patient was given a three-week washout period before starting on clozapine, which was titrated without recurrence of NMS or catatonia. Subsequently, the patient was discharged back to the inpatient psychiatric unit after a month-long hospitalization.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of paroxysmal blurred vision, which he had been experiencing for two months. Upon admission, he underwent lumbar puncture, which showed increased opening pressure, pleocytosis, elevated protein level, and reduced glucose level. CSF cytology showed lymphocytic inflammation. Cryptococcus antigen test and Mycobacterium PCR of the CSF were negative. He was initially diagnosed with possible tuberculous meningitis, and empirical anti-tuberculous therapy was initiated.

However, he was readmitted one month later when his symptoms persisted. A repeat lumbar puncture and NGS of CSF were performed, which yielded negative results. Serum and CSF samples, however, were positive for C. cellulosae IgG, and Head CT revealed a single calcified lesion in the left frontal lobe. Brain MRI showed no obvious abnormalities, including hydrocephalus. He was diagnosed with parenchymal NCC (calcified cyst) and possibly extraparenchymal NCC or spinal NCC without radiological evidence.

Albendazole and dexamethasone treatment was started, but the patient's symptoms and CSF findings worsened initially.

The patient, a 73-year-old Japanese man with a history of hypertensive nephrosclerosis, presented with worsening abdominal pain and cloudy peritoneal fluid. He had previously undergone continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and had a PD catheter removed and inserted on the opposite side due to infection. The peritoneal equilibration test had resulted in high values, and local bowel adhesions were detected by computed tomography (CT) after PD-associated peritonitis. 

During this admission, the patient was diagnosed with PD-associated peritonitis and suspected adhesive small bowel obstruction. As such, he was advised to stop eating and switched from CAPD to hemodialysis. Intravenous vancomycin and cephtazidime were administered, and the PD catheter was flushed to prevent obstruction. Improvement was noted, and oral intake was resumed on day 8. 

However, on day 15, the patient's abdominal pain resumed, and the peritoneal fluid became cloudy with high levels of fibrin and white blood cells. Additionally, fecal material was identified in the PD catheter on day 23. Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides caccae were positive on culture. CT indicated intestinal contents had leaked into the abdominal cavity. As a result, the patient underwent ileocecal resection with colostomy creation. The PD catheter was removed. Pathological examination showed inflammatory cells associated with peritonitis in the intestinal wall, but no signs of EPS or amyloidosis.

The patient's operation was uneventful, and she was discharged on dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 3 days. Three weeks later, she was readmitted to the hospital with persistent fever and chills, and occasional headaches for five days.

Diagnostic Assessment:
On admission, her vitals were notable for a fever of 38.5 °C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 158/83 mmHg. A CT scan was ordered, which showed a subgaleal collection overlying the craniotomy site and hypodense areas in the right cerebellum that likely represented postoperative changes. A hypodense extra-axial collection was noted along the right cerebellum. These findings raised concern for postsurgical meningitis, and the patient was started on antibiotics for a presumptive urinary tract infection. However, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, with the development of nuchal rigidity, altered mental status, and seizures in the next 24 hours. A lumbar puncture was performed, which showed significant inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was then taken to the operating room for placement of an external ventricular drain and intrathecal antibiotic administration. A pathology report revealed fungal elements, and further testing confirmed Aspergillus fumigatus as the causative agent.

Treatment:
The patient was started on liposomal amphotericin and voriconazole for the treatment of CNS aspergillosis, which was eventually transitioned to oral voriconazole 250 mg every 12 hours to complete three months of therapy.

The 65-year old female patient had been on dialysis for 17 years and had a complex medical history, which included a history of heavy smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and various cancers. Upon initial clinical examination, the patient had good psychophysical balance, a moderate impairment in nutritional status, and signs of chronic bronchitis. The clinical examination was unremarkable aside from her heart bruit and mild orthostatic hypotension. Her arterial blood pressure was high, and her heart rate was normal. The patient was on various medications, including antihypertensive drugs, antipsychotics, thyroid hormone, vitamin D supplements, bicarbonate and calcium supplements, potassium, phosphate binders, and darbopoietin.

Diagnostic Workup:
A biochemical control revealed a relevant increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, which was likely caused by interference from the patient's sevelamer dosage. The patient's levothyroxine dose was already high for her body weight, and a reduction in absorption should have been suspected.

Diagnosis: Renal Oncocytoma

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted for postoperative follow-up management after receiving a renal allograft from a deceased  donor. During the routine examination, a 2.4-cm lesion was serendipitously discovered on the upper pole of the renal allograft. Biopsy confirmed the lesion to be consistent with a renal oncocytoma. The eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma was ruled out following negative immunohistochemical staining.

Treatment and Care Plan:

Given the low risk of malignant transformation in an oncocytoma, the decision was made to monitor the tumor with active surveillance. The patient received mycophenolate-mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisone throughout the 5-year follow-up period, and the regimen for immunosuppression was not changed despite the presence of the renal mass. The patient underwent ultrasonography every 2 months for the first year, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every year. The renal oncocytoma displayed no growth, regression, or any other interim morphological changes.

Patient Outcome:

After 60 months of active surveillance, radiological studies have shown no growth, regression, or any other morphological changes to the renal oncocytoma. The patient is alive and well. 

Recommendations:

The patient should continue to undergo annual MRI monitoring to ensure that the tumor remains stable. In case of any changes, further evaluation and treatment will be advised.","What was the management plan for a renal oncocytoma discovered during postoperative follow-up, and what is the recommended surveillance strategy?","The management plan for the discovered renal oncocytoma was active surveillance, and the recommended surveillance strategy is annual MRI monitoring to ensure tumor stability.",Question Answering

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient, a 67-year-old woman, was admitted to the hospital due to retro-orbital pain, increasing over one week, accompanied by progressive exophthalmia, and palpebral ptosis on the left side. Physical examination revealed a complete ptosis of the left eyelid and complete absence of extraocular movements of the left eye, which were referable to the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve. The patient was being treated for lung cancer that had spread to the liver and cerebellum. Head CT scan showed mucous thickening in the left sphenoid and maxillary sinuses. Brain MRI revealed a new expansive lesion in the left cavernous sinus, which was previously not there in a CT performed several weeks ago. The lesion was inseparable from T2-hypointense changes in the posterior part of the left sphenoid sinus.

The patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery, which included removal of mucus and fungal debris confirmed as aspergilloma on pathologic examination. Additionally, a mycotic aneurysm of the intracavernous carotid artery from the spread of invasive aspergillosis from the adjacent sphenoid sinus was diagnosed in this patient. Time-of-flight MRA confirmed the presence of a saccular aneurysm of the cavernous portion of the left internal carotid artery, with evidence of turbulent flow within the aneurysm and with an expansion of the aneurysm towards the left side. 

The patient did not undergo endovascular treatment due to the presence of a single hemorrhagic metastasis in the right cerebellar hemisphere, contraindicating antiaggregative drugs. The multidisciplinary team made the decision to refrain from the treatment due to the dismal prognosis of the malignancy.

Final Diagnosis: Calcific tendinitis of the gluteus medius tendon

Hospital Course:

The above patient was admitted to our institution in April 2013 with acute pain in the left hip following a skiing accident. Clinical examination showed pain and tenderness of the trochanteric region, a normal but painful range of motion, and perithrochanteric calcifications on radiographs. A CT-scan confirmed a well-defined calcification of low density, 18 millimeters in diameter, in the gluteus medius tendon. Given a history of bilateral recurrent calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff, an ultrasound-guided needle lavage was proposed, and corticosteroid injection was performed. The patient's symptoms resolved within a few days, and no follow-up imaging was performed.

In November 2014, the patient returned with similar complaints, but on the right side. An MRI showed a hypo-intense, sharply defined structure in the gluteus medius tendon, and a radiograph confirmed a calcification.

Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 65-year-old female who presented to the tertiary eye centre with symptoms of painless right eye vision distortion that had been ongoing for six weeks. She reported no history of eye injury or trauma. On examination, the patient's VA was found to be 6/24 in the right eye and 6/5 in the left eye. Following slit-lamp biomicroscopy and fundoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with a right eye full-thickness macular hole, a left eye epiretinal membrane, and posterior vitreous detachment.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient underwent right eye pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling and cryotherapy with C3F8 12% gas tamponade. The procedure was successful, and the patient's VA had improved to 6/18 with no complications. Unfortunately, seven weeks postoperatively, the patient developed right eye macula-on RD due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in the inferior retina. RD repair was performed, with a silicone oil (Densiron 68) tamponade and retinectomy to release the PVR. After four months, the patient's VA returned to 6/12 with a flat retina and closed macular hole. However, four months later, the patient's VA declined to 6/36 in the right eye. A fundus fluorescein angiogram confirmed severe CMO in the right eye, for which the patient underwent right eye posterior sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone injection and was started on ketorolac trometamol eye drops (Acular) three times a day and oral acetazolamide 250 mg slow-release twice a day.

TREATMENT INITIATED:
The patient received three posterior sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone injections and two intravitreal triamcinolone injections within 14 months, with no complications. Though the CMO initially responded to each triamcinolone injection, it later recurred. The patient then received four intravitreal dexamethasone 0.7-mg implants (Ozurdex; Allergan, Inc.) uneventfully. While the implants maintained a dry fovea for a longer period, the CMO recurred again. A trial of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (Avastin) was not helpful.

DISCHARGE INFORMATION:
After two years without any successful treatments, the patient decided to receive ILUVIEN intravitreal implant. In the first week, the patient developed mild right eye anterior uveitis with an initial IOP of 27 mmHg in the right eye and 18 mmHg in the left eye, which was successfully managed with dexamethasone drops and latanoprost drops. At the time of this report, it is 20 months since receiving the ILUVIEN implant, and the patient still has a dry fovea with right eye VA at 6/18.

FOLLOW-UP CAREUPON DISCHARGE:
The patient has been advised to attend regular follow-up appointments with her ophthalmologist to monitor her right eye full-thickness macular hole, left eye epiretinal membrane, and posterior vitreous detachment. The patient has been informed about the risks and benefits of any further interventions and is aware that additional treatments may be necessary to manage her condition successfully. The patient has also been advised to report any concerning symptoms promptly. The recommended follow-up interval is three months.","What treatment options were attempted for a 65-year-old female with right eye CMO following macular hole surgery, and which treatment ultimately resulted in successful resolution?","Several treatment options were attempted for the patient's CMO following macular hole surgery, including posterior sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone injections, intravitreal triamcinolone injections, intravitreal dexamethasone implants, and Avastin.

Upon admission, the patient was alert and afebrile. The neurological examination revealed only the worsening of pre-existing visual disturbance. The blood analysis revealed a slight elevation in CRP levels, and the interferon-γ release assay (T-SPOT) was positive. The chest X-ray revealed no abnormal lesions. In addition, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing revealed elevated protein levels, no pleocytosis, and normal glucose levels, with a standard opening pressure. The patient's history comprised tuberculous meningitis treated with anti-TB drugs with adjunctive corticosteroid 10 years ago. 

During the course of treatment, a head CT revealed new emerging tuberculomas in the left sylvian fissure. While a contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed tuberculomas with a diffuse hypointense area around the left sylvian fissure, brain fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging indicated a hyperintense area around the tuberculomas in the left sylvian fissure, suggesting edematous changes. Repeated mycobacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the CSF did not indicate the existence of the reactivation of CNS tuberculosis.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 41-year-old man, was admitted to our hospital after being accidently detected with a mass on the right lobe of the thyroid. The MRI showed a significantly enlarged right lobe of the thyroid that was suspected to be a thyroid adenoma. The patient underwent a right thyroid resection and dissection because of this. However, the pathology after surgery indicated LCH because immunohistochemistry staining confirmed CD1a (+), S100 (+), CD68 (+), Valentine (+), and thyroglobulin (+). The patient received additional treatment that included radiotherapy of 16 regimens combined with interleukin-2 therapy. The patient regularly monitored the function of thyroid and began to take 50 μg Euthyrox (levothyroxine) per day since being diagnosed with hypothyroidism 3 years after subtotal thyroidectomy.

In 2007, the patient was admitted to our hospital again with the complaint of thirst and polyuria for several months. They were diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus (DI) and received 3 tablets of desmopressin acetate (0.3 mg/day) with improvement of the symptoms. Pituitary MRI showed loss of the pituitary posterior lobe signal and the pituitary stalk was slightly thicker. The thyroid and total bone ECT scan were both normal.

In 2008, the patient was admitted to the hospital again, complaining of pain and distension in the upper abdominal area. Abdominal CT showed diffuse fine nodules on the right hepatic with partly fusion. The patient was diagnosed with liver Langerhans cell histiocytosis after percutaneous liver biopsy with immunohistochemical staining.

The patient received chemotherapy of CHOP regime (CTX1350 mg, VCR2 mg, prednisone 100 mg for 5 days,) and radiation therapy of 11 regimens including 16.5 Gy dose. The patient followed up for 5 years, and there was no lesion found in the right lobe during the T1-weighted MR images in 2012 and enhanced MR images of the liver in 2017.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 69-year-old male farmer, presented to our hospital with mild left lower abdominal pain which had started ten months prior to his admission. Physical examination showed upper right abdomen and periumbilical mild tenderness, while labs showed mild anemia, elevated levels of γ-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase, renal dysfunction, and elevated serum amylase levels. Total serum IgG levels were extremely high, while IgG4 was approximately 6 times the normal limit. Radiographs of the chest were unremarkable, but abdominal CT revealed left hydronephrosis and a periaortic mass. The biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass under CT-guidance revealed significant infiltration of lymphocytoplasma cells, fibrosis, and fibrin accumulation. However, immunohistochemical staining did not show IgG4-positive plasmacytes in the retroperitoneal mass. A lip biopsy displayed heavy infiltration of lymphocytes and decreased gland bubbles. Antinuclear antibody titer was significantly lowered to 1:100, and other laboratory data, including serum creatinine and biliary enzymes, were almost normal. After ruling out other possibilities, the patient was finally diagnosed with IgG4-related RPF and overlapping PBC complicated with pSS. The patient received a long-term maintenance dose of 10 mg/d prednisone after steroid tapering. At six-month follow-up, the patient had no disease recurrence.

Discharge Diagnosis: Disseminated intravascular coagulation, acquired hemophilia

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to Instituto Nacional de Cancerología (INC) in Bogotá, Colombia due to the development of a mass in the back region and bilateral vision loss. After an initial clinical exam and biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with high-grade sarcoma with positive margins compatible with myxofibrosarcoma. The patient was examined by clinical oncology, surgical oncology, and radiation oncology services, which indicated that he was not a candidate for chemotherapy, surgical treatment, or radiotherapy because of the extension of the tumor into the upper and lower back and the poor Zubrod performance score.

During inpatient care, the patient developed progressive deterioration of consciousness state, persistent oral cavity bleeding, and laboratory tests showed prolongation of blood clotting time due to the extended partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The mixing study showed PTT fixing with a 50:50 normal plasma sample that lasted for the first and second hour, suggesting intrinsic pathway coagulation factor deficiency and created a clinical suspicion of acquired hemophilia. Additional tests confirmed a diagnosis of acquired hemophilia based on the presence of hidden low-titer inhibitors in the mixing study.

Based on the above findings, oral treatment with an activated prothrombin complex like factor eight (VIII) inhibitor bypassing activity was initiated. A diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was made based on hypofibrinogenemia development, continuous elevation of D-dimer levels, and progressive thrombocytopenia. Despite augmentation of the FEIBA dose and transfusion support in the form of red blood cell units and cryoprecipitate along with electrolyte correction, the patient did not have a positive response to treatment.

The 19-year-old male patient underwent SMILE for myopia in both eyes in June 2013. A history of eye rubbing and allergic conjunctivitis was noted, but there was no prior health concern of pellucid marginal corneal degeneration or family history of keratoconus or high myopia. Preoperative characteristics and parameters suggested no abnormalities. After the procedure, the patient exhibited no complications and was discharged.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
At 1-month post-operation, UDVA was 20/20 in both eyes and corneal topography revealed corneal ectasia. The concerning posterior elevations were detected in both eyes, and respective TCTs were 433 mm and 429 mm in the right and left eyes. After 7.5 months, topography showed more posterior elevation. At 14 months following SMILE, UDVA had decreased to 20/32 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left, with eye rubbing and intermittent allergic conjunctivitis still noted. The patient was treated with simultaneous PTK and CXL (PTK+CXL) for both eyes.

Procedure:
Before CXL, the central 9.0-mm diameter epithelium with a 50 μm depth was removed using EX500 by Wavelight Technologies. PTK+CXL procedure was based on the original CXL procedure, as described by Wollensak et al. Riboflavin solution (0.1%) was administered topically every 2 min for 30 min total, during which the cornea was exposed to ultraviolet A light (370 nm, 3.0 mW/cm2) for 30 min at a distance of 5 cm. Antibiotic eye drops were administrated 4 times-daily for 1 week, and fluorometholone eye drops 0.1% were administrated 4 times-daily for 4 weeks. The patient did not experience any intraoperative or postoperative complications. 

Follow-Up:
Keratometry values, TCT, spherical equivalent, and UDVA were monitored at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after PTK+CXL. At 36-months, maximum corneal keratometry (Kmax) and mean corneal keratometry (Kmean) in the right eye were decreased by 2.6 D and 1.5 D, respectively, while in the left eye, the corresponding reductions were 4.0 D and 1.6 D. TCT had decreased from 432 μm to 412 μm in the right eye but had remained stable in the left eye. Spherical equivalent improved significantly over time, from − 4.25 D to − 2.75 D in the right eye and from − 5.25 D to − 3.5 D in the left eye at 36 months.

During the bilateral astigmatic keratotomy procedure, there was an accidental infusion of distilled water instead of BSS into the anterior chambers of both eyes. Immediate irrigation with BSS was carried out. 

Postoperatively, the patient developed dense superficial punctate keratitis in both eyes, which was treated with topical 1% prednisolone acetate and 5% NaCl eye drops. There were no intraocular pressure changes noted. Corneal edema and anterior chamber reactions persisted despite treatment, and thin vacuolar anterior subcapsular opacity was observed in the right eye. The patient's vision was blurry, and mild pain was experienced in both eyes. 

One week after surgery, there was partial recognition of the clear lens in the nondilated state, and anterior subcapsular cataract decreased in a centripetal pattern. Two weeks after surgery, corneal edema decreased slightly with altered anterior chamber reactions, and the cataract became smaller, exhibiting a moth-eaten appearance. One month after surgery, the corneal and anterior chambers cleared in both eyes, the cataract diminished in size, and a starry appearance was observed. So, SMILE surgery was performed at 2 months after the astigmatic keratotomy. There were no surgical complications noted during the 3-month postoperative follow-up, and the subcapsular cataract of the right eye became fainter.

Admission Diagnosis: Chronic right-sided headache, foul discharge and complaints of a stuffed nose

Hospital Course

The patient was admitted with chronic right-sided headache, foul discharge and complaints of a stuffed nose. He had a previous medical history of maxillary osteomyelitis and had undergone multiple interventions resulting in a complex mediofacial resection.

Diagnostic testing showed a huge pathologic cavity resulting from communication between the oral cavity, right maxillary sinus, and nasal cavity, with a minor communication with the right orbit. Biopsy specimens were obtained under general anesthesia and showed severe but unspecific changes of the nasal epithelium with areas of minimal remaining preserved respiratory epithelium. Evident unspecific changes were also present in the submucosa with squamous cell metaplasia of the submucosal glands in some cases leading to complete replacement of the glandular epithelia and resulting in submucosal squamous cell nests, without signs of cellular atypia.

Based on the clinical data and diagnostic testing, the patient was diagnosed with ENS not elsewhere classified (NEC) as the currently used classification does not include such an entity.

The patient was discharged following training for self-lavage of the neocavity, due to refusal for obturator placement to compartmentalize the neocavity and restore physiological relation of its sections. A seven-year follow-up period included multiple hospital admissions for monitoring of the condition and extensive sinus lavage. No advancement was noticed on endoscopy and CT.

The surgery involved an extended resection of the posterior chest wall with the third to fifth rib being cut. The chest wall defect was covered using Gore-Tex®, a pure and unique expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) prosthesis. The postoperative period was uneventful. However, on postoperative day 6, the patient reported acute severe pain in the right shoulder. Purulent drainage was also observed through the drainage tube that was positioned on the mesh. Pus culture from the drain discharge isolated Corynebacterium atrium. CT revealed that the inferior angle of the scapula was caught inside the top of the sixth rib. Conservative treatment was initiated, but failed to improve the scapular dislocation, and a redo surgery with titanium plate fifth rib fixation was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed that all suture threads attaching the mesh to sixth rib were cut, and the dislocation of the right scapula with the inferior angle protruding into the right intrathoracic cavity through the thoracotomy defect. A local infectious change at the head side of the mesh was observed but no macroscopic intrathoracic infectious changes were found.

Patient Name: [Redacted]
Medical Record Number: [Redacted]

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with severe dyspnea and a history of lymphocytic myocarditis. The patient's comorbidities included stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic gastritis, and Hashimoto thyroiditis. The patient had received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in 2009 and a cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) system in 2012. Despite optimal medical treatment, the patient's dyspnea and quality of life had severely worsened, with a progressive left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction and left ventricular (LV) dilation over the years.

The patient was enrolled in the waiting list for heart transplantation and underwent a CardioMEMS™ implantation in the beginning of 2017. Within the first three months, the patient underwent two diuretic dose adjustments and a month later, the CardioMEMS™ documented a rise in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), 34/24/17 mmHg. The patient was then admitted to the hospital.

Diagnostic Testing and Therapeutic Interventions:
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed the patient's long-standing dilated cardiomyopathy picture with severe global LV hypokinesia and an ejection fraction of 30%. After excluding any potential cause accounting for the acute presentation, the patient received a 24-h infusion of calcium sensitizer levosimendan. At hospital discharge, the patient's basic hemodynamics improved, as shown by a drop in estimated systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and an increased cardiac output. Pulmonary artery mean pressure at one week dropped after levosimendan infusion.

A single-beat view of the PAP before and after levosimendan administration clearly showed a decreased pulmonary mean pressure, as well as a decreased pulmonary pulse pressure at an unchanged heart rate. However, despite the initiation of an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) that replaced the ACEI, a quick relapse and rise in PAP was observed. Given clinical and hemodynamic worsening despite Levosimendan administration and heart failure therapy optimization, LVAD-Implantation was indicated. A few weeks later, the patient underwent a LVAD Heart Mate III implantation as a bridge to heart transplantation. The procedure was uneventful and the patient was discharged home. 

Outcomes and Follow-up:
Since LVAD-implantation, the patient's NYHA class improved to class II and her hemodynamic parameters have stabilized at lower pulmonary pressures over 7 months.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Dilated cardiomyopathy, NYHA class III-IV with severe LV systolic dysfunction, history of lymphocytic myocarditis, CKD stage III, chronic gastritis and Hashimoto thyroiditis.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should have regular follow-up appointments with the cardiology team to evaluate her hemodynamics and NYHA class. The patient should also be monitored for any signs of device malfunction or infection related to the LVAD Heart Mate III. In addition, the patient should be advised to continue taking medications as prescribed and to follow a heart-healthy lifestyle.

Hospital Course:
The patient was an 11-year-old male who presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe abdominal pain that was causing difficulty with sleeping and ambulation. Physical examination revealed a fever and localized peritonitis. Pertinent laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis and neutrophilia. The initial leading differential diagnosis was constipation; however, an aperistaltic mass was discovered in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) during a point-of-care ultrasound, which suggested acute appendicitis.

After consulting with the pediatric surgery team, contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was performed and demonstrated surgical changes of appendectomy with staple lines at the blind end of the appendiceal stump. A high-density appendicolith was obstructing the base of the appendiceal stump, which was surrounded by mesenteric fat stranding. Thickening of the appendiceal wall and the peritoneal reflection of the RLQ were additional findings consistent with acute appendicitis.

The patient underwent laparoscopic surgery, which revealed an inflamed appendiceal stump with pus in the right paracolic gutter. The appendiceal wall was very friable, and the stump required piecemeal removal during which time two appendicoliths were discovered in the lumen. The base was stapled flush with the cecum, ensuring that no residual appendicoliths were present.

Pathology confirmed that the stump was necrotic, in two 2 cm long portions, with one portion containing a large appendicolith. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was discharged on postoperative day 3 with good recovery. Appropriate follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the patient's recovery.

1627,"Hospital Course Summary:

This is a brief summary of the hospital course of a 59-year-old male who underwent elective open retropubic prostatectomy, as described in the case report. After discussion with the surgical team, the anaesthetic plan consisted of general anesthesia (GA) with postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine.

The patient had essential hypertension and was on ACE-I medication, which was discontinued 48 hours before the operation. The preoperative assessment showed no other abnormalities. During the surgery, the patient experienced hypotension and bradycardia, which were treated with ephedrine. An arterial blood gas (ABG) test showed hyperkalemia and acidosis, which was initially thought to be respiratory acidosis. However, after increasing ventilation parameters, ABG showed normal PCo2 with normal anion gap acidosis and increasing potassium level. Hyperkalemia was treated with glucose-insulin and mild hyperventilation, and potassium level decreased. However, acidosis persisted for three hours despite the normalization of potassium levels. It did not affect the patient's emergence from anesthesia or recovery.

The estimated blood loss was approximately 635 ml, and the urinary output was 700 ml. The infused fluids included Hartman's solution, normal saline, and Gelofusine 4% in addition to glucose 10% with insulin. No blood transfusion was required. Postoperative follow-up for renal function tests and electrolytes showed normalization over a period of two days postoperatively. Intake of ACE-I medication was restored on day one postoperatively with no effect on potassium level.

In conclusion, the patient underwent an uneventful open retropubic prostatectomy under general anesthesia with postoperative patient-controlled analgesia. He experienced hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis during surgery, which were treated successfully. Renal function tests and electrolytes normalized over the course of two days postoperatively. Intake of ACE-I medication was reinstated with no effect on potassium level.

Sex: Female
Age: 64
Admission Date: [date]
Discharge Date: [date]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient was admitted to the emergency unit with complaints of headache and fever for one week. She reported pain over her whole skull without any specific trigger point. Cranial and peripheral neurologic function did not have any impairment. There was no nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, or nuchal stiffness.

MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient denied drug or alcohol abuse.

FINDINGS:
Laboratory examination disclosed a normocytic anemia. Blood chemistry tests revealed abnormally elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. Chest X-ray routine film showed no active lung lesions. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head was ordered to rule out intracranial abscess or other central nervous system problems.

DIAGNOSIS:
Multiple osteolytic lesions were detected in the skull, and subsequent immunofixation electrophoresis analysis of serum did not show any evidence of monoclonal gammopathy. Levels of serum tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) were meaningfully increased in concentration but levels of cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) were within normal limits. A CT scan of chest and abdomen revealed osteosclerotic and osteolytic lesions similar to that of skull involving almost the whole skeleton but not a single clear-cut primary tumor site could be located. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed on the right side, posterior superior iliac crest, which revealed a metastatic adenocarcinoma.

TREATMENT:
Due to concern about the risk of fracture, the patient began to take tamoxifen, 20 mg twice daily. The effect seemed very satisfactory. After a period of probable “tamoxifen flare” with elevation of serum CA 15-3 and alkaline phosphatase levels for six weeks, both of them dropped gradually within four months (). Serum CA15-3 was within normal limits at the last follow-up. Positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) scans during the treatment course confirmed an impressive improvement of the bone marrow uptake. The mild activity remained in the lumbar spine could be either residual metastasis or, more favored by us, compensatory hyperactive hematopoiesis in its recovery phase (). 

SUMMARY:
The patient was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma due to the osteolytic lesions found on a CT scan of the skull. The patient was started on tamoxifen, 20 mg twice daily, which had a satisfactory effect. After a period of probable “tamoxifen flare” with elevation of serum CA 15-3 and alkaline phosphatase levels for six weeks, both of them dropped gradually within four months. Serum CA15-3 was within normal limits at the last follow-up. PET/CT scans during the treatment course confirmed an impressive improvement of the bone marrow uptake. The patient did not have headache or fever anymore and was discharged in stable condition.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient was advised to follow-up with her physician regularly for further assessment and treatment. Additionally, it is recommended that the patient continues taking tamoxifen as prescribed. The patient was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and exercise regularly to improve overall health. The patient was also advised to report any new symptoms that occur during the course of her treatment.","What was the diagnosis of the patient with complaints of headache and fever for one week leading to the detection of osteolytic lesions in the skull, and what was the treatment given?","The patient was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma due to the osteolytic lesions found on a CT scan of the skull.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 14-year-old female with a history of anxiety, depression, chronic migraines, and complex regional pain syndrome of the lower extremities, was admitted to the pediatric psychiatric unit for evaluation and treatment due to severe depression and suicidal ideation. During her admission, she reported exacerbation of her bilateral leg pain, which significantly limited her mobility and worsened her mood.

The patient had received multiple classes of pain medication and various interventions, including acupuncture, physical therapy, and guided imagery therapy, without significant relief of symptoms. She did not meet the criteria for complex regional pain syndrome and her neurological exam was otherwise intact.

After consultation with the pain management team, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit for intravenous ketamine infusion and monitoring. The patient remained hemodynamically stable with no dysphoria or hallucinations throughout the course of her treatment.

On day one of intravenous ketamine infusion, the patient had significant improvement of her depressive symptoms and a maximum pain score of 6/10. On day two, she reported less pain in her legs with a maximum pain score of 5/10 and significant improvement in her mood with no further suicidal ideations. On day three, the intravenous ketamine infusion was increased, but nystagmus and visual changes were noted and therefore the infusion was decreased. On day four, the patient had a maximum pain score of 4/10 and self-reported 70% pain relief since initiation of intravenous ketamine infusion. On day five, the infusion was titrated down with no reported pain and sustained improvement in mood. The ketamine infusion was discontinued on the same day.

The patient had five months of symptom relief after her first intravenous ketamine infusion. She was readmitted five months later with repeated suicide attempts, depression, and worsening bilateral upper and lower extremity neuropathic pain, though with decreased baseline pain. Due to her dramatic improvement and sustained relief with intravenous ketamine infusion during her last admission, as well as the lack of other successful treatment options, she was again admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for five days of intravenous ketamine infusion with resolution of her neuropathic pain and suicidal/depressive symptoms allowing for discharge home without any immediate sequelae.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our Fetal Medicine Centre at 19+5 weeks of gestation due to positive serology for syphilis in the first trimester. No clinical manifestations of the disease were found during the examination. The patient had a history of a feverish erythematosus maculopapular rash localized to trunk, limbs, palms, and soles two years before. The diagnosis of syphilis was performed only during antenatal screening in the first trimester by a positive venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and a treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) title of 1:2560. The HIV status of the patient was negative.

Antibiotic therapy was immediately started with benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, administered as 3 doses of 2.4 million units IM each at 1-week intervals according to the stage of syphilis, in line with CDC guidelines. Syphilis serology tests were stable with VDRL positive and a TPHA title of 1:2560 at the end of the treatment. The patient's husband also had positive VDRL (1:320) and TPHA titres, and he was treated with a recommended regimen.

The scan performed at 19+5 weeks of gestation revealed no abnormalities, and fetal growth parameters were normal. However, at 23+5 weeks of gestation, a follow-up scan showed a massive hydrocephalus, severe hydrothorax, ascites, and hepatomegaly. The measurement of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) showed an increased peak systolic velocity for gestational age. The patient's blood tests for cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, parvovirus, toxoplasma, and herpes virus types 1 and 2 were found negative while syphilis serologic tests were confirmed positive with RPR title 1:4 and TPHA title 1:640. Fetal karyotype was normal. After thorough counseling on the fetal anomaly, the patient decided to pursue the termination of pregnancy.

Fetal autopsy showed multiple abnormalities including a cutaneous erythematous papular disseminated rash, widespread edema, ascites, hydrothorax, internal obstructed hydrocephalus, ischemic-haemorrhagic brain injury with disseminated lesions, productive pachymeningitis with dystrophic calcification, hepatomegaly, acute hepatic and splenic hematopoiesis, productive bilateral peripyelitis, pronounced glomerulus-poiesis, and involution of the thymus. The research of Treponema Pallidum with coloring of Warthin-Starry identified images compatible with the morphological appearance of the germ.

Hospital course:

The patient was admitted to the cardiology department with non-exertional chest pain and was found to have total occlusion of the right coronary artery, which was treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Following the procedure, he experienced hypotension, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mass in the left atrium. He was transferred to our clinic for surgery with a possible diagnosis of LA myxoma. During surgery, a giant mass was found near the mitral valve invading myocardium towards the posterior wall of the LA. The mass was excised, and the posterior atrial wall was repaired by autologous pericardium. Histopathologic examination of the specimen revealed necrotic areas, lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltration, and sporadic eosinophilia in the striated muscle fibers. There were also multinuclear giant cells. These giant cells showed positive expression with CD45 and CD68, with the final diagnosis of giant cell myocarditis (-).

The patient had a first-degree heart blockage, which required the insertion of a temporary pacemaker lead during the surgical procedure. Following the surgery, a bypass over PD segment was performed for the RCA using saphenous vein graft. The patient had sinus rhythm after 24 hours and stayed in the ICU for two days post-surgery.

Hospital Course:

A 14-month-old female child was brought to the hospital due to abnormal appearance and growth retardation. Antenatal history revealed a full-term birth, 41 weeks of gestation, with no evidence of distress or hypoxia. Upon assessment, the child had a weak cry, cyanosis, and abnormal appearance. She was found to have a height and weight three percentage points below the reference levels. Additionally, a continuous murmur was heard at the second intercostal space towards the left margin of the sternum and cranial MRI revealed bilateral widening of the frontal subarachnoid space, characteristic of the Dandy-Walker syndrome and enlarged ventricles.

Further investigations were conducted, which revealed a female mosaic karyotype 47, XX, + 10/ 46, XX with trisomy 10 in 42% of metaphases in the blood. Echocardiography detected a maximal shunt velocity of 465 cm/s, with a mean pressure gradient of 86 mmHg, and a 2-mm wide oblique separation, indicative of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and a patent foramen ovale. Subsequent examinations for inherited metabolic diseases were normal.

During the hospital stay, the child's general condition remained stable. There were no significant changes in her physical appearance or any notable abnormalities discovered. At the most recent follow-up, her height has increased by 2 cm and weight has increased by 0.6 kg.

The patient, a 57-year-old male, was admitted in June 2014 due to increasing abdominal pain. A colonoscopy was performed which revealed a stenotic and ulcerated lesion in the sigmoid region. Computed tomography (CT) revealed hepatic nodules, a hypodense nodular formation in the right adrenal gland, and a focal wall thickening in the descending colon. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination showed pulmonary micronodules, suggestive of secondary implants. The patient underwent a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with primary colorectal anastomosis, followed by palliative chemotherapy. The patient received FOLFOX (10 cycles) as a first-line treatment and FOLFIRI (3 cycles) as second-line regimen. CT imaging was conducted every 2-3 months to evaluate the hepatic lesions, and the serum marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was evaluated. Microscopic evaluation of the surgical specimen revealed a moderately differentiated sigmoid adenocarcinoma with mucinous pattern areas. The pathology stage was pT4apN2apM1, and lymph-node metastases were detected in four of fourteen lymph-nodes dissected from adjacent adipose.

The patient presented with sudden onset of difficulty using her left hand and walking during her menstrual phase. She also complained of headache, abdominal pain, nausea, and had a fever. Neurologic examination revealed left spatial neglect, left facial hypoalgesia, mild paresis in her left arm, and right pyramidal signs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilaterally multiple infarctions in the cerebrum and cerebellum, including cortical and subcortical lesions. MR angiography presented severe stenosis in the M2, M3, >and M4 portions of the right middle cerebral artery. Contrast computed tomography revealed a splenic infarction. Blood examination revealed normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and low-grade elevation of C-reactive protein. The serum levels of D-dimer, CA125, and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) were increased. Results of a hypercoagulable panel were within normal limits. Pelvic MRI revealed giant adenomyosis, but no malignancy was detected.

The patient was initially treated with edaravone and anticoagulated with heparin for 2 weeks, followed by rivaroxaban. At day 31, a day after her menstrual phase started, she complained of numbness in her left lower limb. Brain MRI revealed a new cerebral infarction in the right cerebrum. The serum levels of D-dimer, CA125, and CA19–9 were decreased, and anticoagulant therapy with warfarin was initiated. Afterwards, she started to receive pseudomenopause treatment with a GnRH agonist for the adenomyosis. Ten days after initiating the GnRH agonist treatment, her serum D-dimer level improved. She continued the warfarin and GnRH agonist once a month for 6 months, and showed no recurrence of cerebral infarctions during that time. The serum levels of CA125 and CA19–9 improved after 3 months of initiating the therapy.

The patient presented with transient weakness of her right lower limb and visited the clinic 5 months after her last GnRH agonist therapy.

Patient: 42-year-old female

Medical History:

The patient presented with a primary complaint of pain in the left side of her face for 3 years. She had a history of burning, a pricking type of dysesthesia, intermittent in nature and radiating to the left temporal and orbital region. The unremitting nature of pain often made her feel anxious and agitated with lack of sleep. An array of investigations was performed ranging from MRI brain, OPG, and cephalograms that turned out to be inconclusive.

Hospital Course:

On clinical examination, a sharp localized pain in the hamular region was evident on palpation due to the elongated hamular process that had a knife-edge bony projection. The overlying palatal mucosa had no change in color or texture. A local anesthetic infiltration was injected with subsequent impermanent relief of symptoms in a localized area.

Following a failure of conservative remedies in the past, a prominent elongated hamular process noticed on a cone beam computed tomography and a positive diagnostic block, we opted for a surgical shaving in pursuit of pain relief.

The patient underwent a longitudinal incision of the mucosa and dissection up to the pterygoid hamulus followed by resection of the hamulus from its base. The gross specimen measured 13 mm in length and its shape resembled an arrowhead.

Postoperative Course:

The patient recovered well and was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with the treating physician.

Sex: Female
Diagnosis: Schwannoma, Cognard IIa+b Dural Arteriovenous Fistula

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with symptoms of right ear congestion, pulsatile tinnitus, and mild hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lobulated mass at the cerebellopontine angle. An Octreoscan was performed, which showed intense tracer uptake in the mass, thereby supporting the diagnosis of paraganglioma. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was conducted, which demonstrated a lack of vascularity associated with the tumor. However, it revealed an incidental discovery of a Cognard IIa+b dural arteriovenous fistula in the right posterior fossa. Due to the extensive volume of the tumor, the patient underwent a staged surgical resection.
The first surgery included a modified radical right neck dissection, right superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection, as well as the initial approach to the tumor and partial extradural resection. One week later, the patient underwent the second stage surgery where the tumor was radically resected using a right transcochlear approach. The right sigmoid sinus was ligated. The facial nerve was mobilized and transposed. Postoperative MRI confirmed complete resection of the tumor. Histological analysis of samples from both surgeries confirmed the tumor not to be a paraganglioma, but instead a schwannoma.
The patient had a long recovery from the surgery due to the lower cranial nerve palsies but has shown gradual improvement. Her latest follow-up MRI showed no evidence of recurrent tumor. DSA revealed large feeders from the right middle meningeal artery (MMA) and occipital arteries into the residual dural arteriovenous fistula. The fistula was embolized utilizing Onyx in the right MMA. Final right common carotid artery (CCA) angiogram demonstrated resolution in arteriovenous shunting. Vertebral artery injection after embolization demonstrated minimal residual shunting via the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA).

Discharge Diagnosis: Lung metastasis resembling low-grade right ureteral orifice bladder tumor

Hospital Course: 

Patient presented to the hospital with signs and symptoms of lung metastasis that resembled the low-grade right ureteral orifice bladder tumor. The patient had a 40 pack-year smoking history and had previously undergone transurethral resection of the bladder tumor and ureteroscopic resection of the right ureter. The patient also underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy for upper urinary tract tumor removal. Following the surgery, the patient underwent six rounds of bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment in an adjuvant setting, followed by maintenance treatment for three years.

After careful examination, the patient's mutations present in the tumors were analyzed to identify genetic changes that could point towards a therapeutic target for any future recurrence or metastasis. Variants shared by the primary bladder tumor and the lung metastasis include mutations in the KMT2D and RXRA genes. Mutations unique to the lung metastasis included a clinically actionable, activating mutation in mTOR (C1483F). 

A mutational signature for the patient was developed, which resembled published mutational Signature 1A/B and Signature 5. Using the Drug Gene Interaction Database, candidate drugs targeting 12 of the 100 genes with SNVs in the lung tumor were identified, including the RXRA agonist bexarotene and mTOR inhibitors like everolimus. 

Primary culture of the lung metastasis was established in the laboratory, and the cells were treated with mTOR inhibitor everolimus at two concentrations (10 and 50 nM). The treatment showed a marked inhibition of mTOR activity and downstream signaling via two of its effectors, p70 S6K and 4E-BP1, at both concentrations. AKT activity increased with everolimus treatment, possibly indicating a mechanism of resistance to the mTOR inhibitor. 

On discharge, the patient was advised to follow up with their oncologist regarding further treatment options and therapy. Further genetic testing was recommended, along with regular lung function and cancer screenings due to the patient's history of tobacco smoking. The patient was discharged in stable condition and was advised to attend all follow-up appointments as scheduled.","What genetic changes were identified in the lung metastasis, and which candidate drugs were identified to target the mutations found?","The identified mutations in the lung metastasis included mutations in the KMT2D and RXRA genes shared by the primary bladder tumor and a clinically actionable activating mutation in mTOR (C1483F) unique to the lung metastasis.

Chemotherapy with high CNS penetrating therapeutic agents including high-dose methotrexate, high-dose Ara-C, and thiotepa followed by high-dose chemotherapy with BCNU and thiotepa rescued by autologous stem cell transplantation was initiated, but was poorly tolerated after one cycle due to patient intolerance. The patient was then switched to cladribine, which was better tolerated. However, within two weeks after the completion of this infusion, the patient developed symptoms of malignant meningitis and was started on IV antibiotics.
The patient underwent further radiation therapy targeting C4-C6 and T1-T7 for new lesions consistent with metastatic disease in the untreated cervical spinal cord and thoracic vertebrae, including intramedullary involvement. The patient was then started on Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with known CNS penetration, but was poorly tolerated because of nausea, diarrhea, and acute pancreatitis and was discontinued after one week. CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed progressive bilateral pulmonary nodules. An MRI of the spine showed persistent but significantly improved leptomeningeal enhancement.
Due to progression of symptoms, worsening systemic disease despite control of CNS disease, and limited systemic options available, the patient chose to enroll in hospice.

Patient: [Patient's Name]
Sex: Male
Age: 57 years

Admission Diagnosis: Oxygen Desaturation

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the ICU one week after a positive COVID-19 result due to oxygen desaturation. Physical therapy was initiated promptly after admission, which helped improve the patient's breathing frequency and oxygen saturation. The patient was guided to achieve a prone position resulting in a significant increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. The patient continued to receive intensive physical therapy, positioning, and oxygen therapy for the next few days. Although there were challenges in achieving the prone position due to the patient's profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and high risk of symptom exacerbation, the medical team succeeded in implementing a safe and individualized approach.

After three days with this regime, the patient was transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists continued his rehabilitation, including walking and strength training. However, the patient's severe instability remained a challenge. Nevertheless, after nine days from ICU admission, the patient was successfully discharged from the hospital as a pedestrian.

Discharge Condition:

At the time of discharge, the patient's medical condition had significantly improved, and he was considered stable enough to be discharged from the hospital. The patient's oxygen saturation had returned to normal limits, and his breathing frequency had decreased significantly.

Summary:

This course summary demonstrates that the patient responded positively to a physical therapy treatment regimen, including positioning, deep-breathing exercises, and walking. Although the patient's medical condition was quite severe during the initial ICU admission, his rehabilitation resulted in marked improvement, leading to a successful discharge from the hospital.","What were the key improvements in the patient's medical condition during the hospital course, and how was physical therapy utilized to achieve these results?","During the hospital course, the patient's medical condition improved significantly, with his breathing frequency decreasing and oxygen saturation returning to normal limits.

Patient: 52-year-old male hospitalized for pneumonia and moderate ARDS

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital four days after the beginning of a dry cough, fever, and head and limb pain and tested COVID-19 positive. One day later, he was diagnosed with pneumonia that progressed into moderate ARDS and required mechanical ventilation and intermittent dialysis. After extubation, the patient experienced disorientation and an inability to communicate verbally due to global weakness (CPAx 11/50), accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Specialized physical therapy with the Gugging Swallowing Screen confirmed severe dysphagia, with the patient showing insufficient protection against aspiration. Treatment included therapy for dysphagia, such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and protection mechanism training, while receiving no food or drink by mouth. Over the next few days, the patient was able to swallow pureéd food and mildly thick liquids under supervision, although cough strength remained weak. The patient progressed gradually and became capable of independent food ingestion before discharge.

Discharge:
The patient was discharged 25 days after admission to a rehabilitation clinic. The patient's respiratory condition stabilized, although dysphagia was still evident, with mild oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that continued to compromise paresthesia and needed ongoing regular oral care.

Hospital Course:
A 36-year-old premenopausal woman with a family history of colorectal, hepatobiliary cancerspresented with an abnormal right breast lump. Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound showed a highly suggestive malignant breast mass, which was confirmed by a biopsy of the dominant lesion. The patient underwent a right breast simple mastectomy with axillary lymph node evaluation and her pathology showed a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. She received adjuvant PMRT 5000 cGy dose, 25 fractions with 1000 cGy scar boost. Based on TEXT/SOFT data, ovarian suppression was recommended to be considered as the patient had high-risk features. The patient was started on ovarian suppression with goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days along with letrozole 2.5 mg once daily. Sixteen months after initiation of ovarian suppression, the patient started having a regular menstrual cycle while on goserelin. Given the high-risk disease, the benefit of continued ovarian suppression plus AIs versus tamoxifen alone was discussed, and the patient was hesitant about oophorectomy. She was started on triptorelin 3.75 mg IM once every 28 days.

Patient Name: [Redacted]
DOB: [Redacted]
Discharge Date: [Redacted]

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 34-year-old primigravida, presented with a complicated pregnancy that required an emergency c-section at 36 weeks due to severe fetal distress. Unfortunately, the child was born with several congenital abnormalities and passed away at two months of age due to respiratory failure and multiple associated complications. The team of medical professionals performed several tests, including thoracic X-rays, transfontanelar ultrasound, head CT, muscular biopsy, and tests for aminoacidopathies and spinal muscular atrophy, but the patient's clinical outcomes remained unexplained.

Diagnosis:
Based on the tests and investigations performed, a suspected genetic syndrome that had not yet been diagnosed was deemed the underlying cause. The patient's genomic profile indicated the loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 1, 5, and 8, while duplication was present in chromosomes 10 and 16. The patient's parents received genetic counseling, and they agreed to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-M). The protocol resulted in two blastocysts available for biopsy, of which one was identified as a carrier of the mother's mutation and the other as WT for both mutations.

Treatment:
The embryo identified as WT for both mutations was transferred to the patient's uterus via frozen-thawed embryo transfer. The patient's pregnancy progressed uneventfully, with regular non-invasive double marker tests and fetal DNA analyses using maternal blood, as well as an invasive amniocentesis at 17 weeks of gestation, indicating a normal genetic profile. All the non-invasive ultrasound scans showed normal growth and organ development throughout the pregnancy, and at 38 weeks, a healthy female baby was delivered via C-section, receiving an APGAR score of 9.

Follow-up:
The patient and her newborn were discharged in stable condition and were advised to follow up with their primary care provider to ensure proper care and support.

Summary:
The patient's complicated pregnancy was due to a suspected genetic syndrome that had not yet been diagnosed. Following IVF with PGT-M, the patient delivered a healthy female baby, and both were discharged in stable condition. The patient and her newborn were advised to follow up with their primary care provider and receive necessary support.",What was the suspected genetic syndrome that caused the patient's complicated pregnancy and what was the protocol used to prevent recurrence in the subsequent pregnancy?,"The suspected genetic syndrome that caused the patient's complicated pregnancy was not yet diagnosed but was identified as having loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 1, 5, and 8 and duplication on chromosomes 10 and 16.

Patient: 82-year-old male with HCC and PVTT

Admission Date: [Date]

Discharge Date: [Date]

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to our department for the surgical treatment of HCC with PVTT invasion. Due to overwhelming PVTT extensions, old age, and poor performance status, the patient was not a surgical candidate and received a combination treatment of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with radiotherapy for PVTT.

During preparation for radiotherapy, the patient developed anal pain and persistent fever, and CT showed perianal abscess due to anal fistula. The patient recovered soon after percutaneous abscess drainage but the adverse event interrupted atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, and radiotherapy could not be introduced.

Abdominal CT showed size reduction of the main tumor and PVTT, with a reduction in tumor enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT. Serum AFP levels decreased from 90,700 ng/mL before treatment to 18,371 ng/mL and 6301 ng/mL 3 and 5 weeks after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, respectively. The patient continued the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment after creating colostomy, performed 47 days after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.

Subsequently, beginning from the 83rd day after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, the patient received atezolizumab monotherapy. The reason for choosing atezolizumab monotherapy was that the bleeding from the colostomy persisted from the collateral blood circulation due to the liver cirrhosis. The patient received a one-time atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment and continued with atezolizumab monotherapy afterward (9 regimens administered until now); there is no apparent sign of residual tumors at 9 months after the introduction of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment.

Reason for Admission: Post-surgical pain management following pelvic exenteration due to cervical carcinoma

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital for the management of post-surgical pain following pelvic exenteration due to cervical carcinoma. She was started on continuous intravenous infusion of oxycodone at 30 mg/day, which was gradually increased to a maximum dose of 288 mg/day (MED 576 mg/day) to manage the pain. As the pain subsided, the dose was gradually reduced, and the intravenous infusion was discontinued at a dose of 18 mg/day. However, six hours after discontinuation, the patient developed restlessness and an itching sensation in her legs, likely due to an opioid withdrawal syndrome. To manage the symptoms, the continuous intravenous infusion of oxycodone was resumed at a dose of 18 mg/day, and the symptoms disappeared. The oxycodone dose was further reduced and discontinued gradually over 10 days. Subsequently, the patient did not report any withdrawal symptoms.

Summary:

Chief Complaint: Bilateral intermittent claudication and exertional dyspnea

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted with complaints of bilateral intermittent claudication and exertional dyspnea. The patient was a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the past 28 years and was being treated with insulin. The patient had diabetic retinopathy and had a history of smoking, with a 40 pack-year history. On vascular examination, there was a right femoral bruit, diminished right popliteal pulse, and absent right and left dorsalis pedis pulses. These findings suggested the presence of right femoral and bilateral infrapopliteal lesions.

The patient's right ABI and left ABI were within normal range; however, the upstroke times in the right and left ankles were prolonged (≥ 180 milliseconds), indicating the presence of bilateral lower-extremity PAD. Furthermore, the right ABI decreased from 1.11 to 0.48, and the left ABI decreased from 1.03 to 0.67 after exercise. Computed tomography angiography revealed the presence of right SFA stenotic lesions, bilateral infrapopliteal occlusive lesions, and spotty calcification in bilateral infrapopliteal arteries. Intra-arterial angiography showed the presence of right SFA stenotic lesions and bilateral infrapopliteal occlusive lesions. Coronary angiography showed severe stenotic lesions in the right coronary artery and the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for the LAD stenosis. 

After percutaneous coronary intervention, the patient underwent supervised exercise training. The patient was discharged in stable condition with appropriate medication and follow-up was advised.

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient was admitted with complaints of bilateral intermittent claudication and exertional dyspnea. After a thorough examination, it was determined that the patient had right femoral and bilateral infrapopliteal lesions, requiring both computed tomography angiography and intra-arterial angiography.

Hospital Course:
The 9-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital due to intermittent right lower abdominal pain, anorexia, vomit, and high-grade fever. Initial examination showed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and an elevated C-reactive protein. A heterogeneous lesion of 40 × 37 mm within the colon, no appendix and some swollen mesenteric nodes of at least 10 mm were reported. A complementary abdominal CT scan revealed findings suggestive of ileocolic intussusception with an invagination area of approximately 6.6 × 4.9 cm. After surgical consult, the patient underwent an exploratory laparoscopy that required laparotomy conversion. A well-defined, 5 cm mass at the ileocecal valve and multiple hard pericecal lymph nodes were observed. Preserved permeability between the ileum and colon, complete integrity of the cecum wall, and lack of vermiform appendix were also reported. 

Treatment:
The patient was admitted to the inpatient floor where antibiotic therapy based on ampicillin sulbactam, and metronidazole was initiated. The oncologist department was consulted and complementary laboratory exams were ordered. Antibiotic therapy was changed to piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin due to the uncertainty of the etiology of her clinical picture. Bowel rest was initiated, and parenteral nutrition was administered. Later, a regular diet was successfully initiated.

Diagnosis:
The histopathological report described an incidental well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor grade I pT1 pN0 at the tip of the appendix in the middle of a clinical picture caused by an acute necrotizing appendicitis of a complete subserosal appendix. The patient underwent an omentectomy and resection of approximately 40 cm of terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending colon. Pericolonic lymph nodes were resected as well.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 51-year-old female of Han ethnicity, was admitted to our hospital in September 2018 after developing pain, redness, and hyperemia in her right eye following entry of some cigarette ash. Corneal scraping was performed, and antifungal and antibacterial therapy with levofloxacin eye drops, cefminox sodium, and voriconazole was initiated. After two weeks of outpatient treatment, the patient was hospitalized due to the appearance of a grayish-white ulcer in her cornea.

Diagnostic findings:

The patient underwent a penetrating keratoplasty, and exudation was noted in the anterior chamber post-surgery. Intracameral fluconazole injection was administered, but the infiltrates continued to progressively worsen and remained unresponsive to any treatment. A subsequent enucleation was performed due to persistent infection. A sample of the corneal fragment revealed a positive culture for a fungus that was definitively identified as P. insidiosum by ITS rRNA gene sequencing analysis.

Treatment course:

The patient was treated with antifungal medications and underwent surgical intervention in a bid to relieve her symptoms. Unfortunately, these attempts were unsuccessful, and the patient ultimately required enucleation of the affected eye. 

Follow-up:

Follow-up care with ophthalmology is recommended for the patient to assess the outcome of the intervention and provide any necessary care.","Can you provide a brief summary of the hospital course, diagnostic findings, treatment course, and follow-up care for a 51-year-old female patient with a corneal infection caused by P. insidiosum according to the given discharge summary?","The 51-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital due to a corneal infection caused by P. insidiosum.

305,"Hospital Course:

This is a comprehensive discharge summary for a 55-year-old male of Han nationality who was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of irritation, pain, and hyposesthesia in the left eye. Patient's presenting complaints were initially diagnosed as viral keratitis at a local ophthalmic clinic. However, after 4 days of antiviral therapy, no significant improvement was observed, and the patient was eventually referred to our hospital. Upon admission, the patient presented with conjunctival hypertrophy and infiltrated growth into cornea about 2 mm from the nasal limbus, microvascular tissue hypertrophy of about 2.5 mm across the corneal limbus, and hyperemia grayish-white infiltrate of cornea about 5 mm in diameter.

Diagnostic Approach:

The patient underwent direct microscopy of corneal scrapings stained with Gram and KOH preparation, which yielded negative results for organisms. The patient was then prescribed empiric fortified topical and systemic antibiotics, including ornidazole, tobramycin, vancomycin, natamycin, and fluconazole. However, after three days, there was still no noteworthy improvement, prompting the decision to perform an excision of pterygium and therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty in the left eye. Cultures of the patient's corneal tissue for bacteria, fungus, and Acanthamoeba were negative. Because there was evidence of increased keratoneuritis, antiamebic therapy (chlorhexidine) was initiated, and voriconazole was also added. Yet, twelve days after the surgery, corneal opacity was rescraped, and the infiltration extended deeply into the anterior chamber. A second penetrating keratoplasty was performed, virtually limbus to limbus, along with an intracameral amphotericin B injection. 

Outcome:

The patient's medical condition did not improve. 10 days after the second operation, the infection spread to the adjacent sclera and progressed to endophthalmitis, necessitating enucleation. Eventually, the corneal cultures growing on PDA plate were identified as P. insidiosum by MALDI-TOF-MS, confirming the diagnosis of pythiosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was admitted for severe anorexia nervosa, depression, anxiety, and compulsive tendencies. The patient had a history of multiple admissions to different healthcare facilities for anorexia nervosa and aggressive behavior. During the hospital course, the patient had symptoms of sadness, loneliness, anhedonia, and hopelessness and had minimum interest in seeking treatment for her eating disorder. The patient was placed in 1:1 supervision for safety concerns, as she had a history of physically aggressive behavior towards the staff and family.

During the admission, the patient refused to take her medication for anxiety and hid meals. She was physically restrained and had to receive emergency medication, as she posed a risk to herself and others. She was transferred to our hospital after stabbing her father with a knife, blaming him for her eating disorder treatment. She was handcuffed and ankle-cuffed to the bed throughout her stay.

The patient was diagnosed with Conduct Disorder (CD) after the violent incident, and the eating disorder facility refused to accept the patient, leading to her treatment plan being revised. Behavioral expectations and positive reinforcement were implemented for meeting the patient's daily nutritional needs. She was prescribed chlorpromazine to address her aggression. After gaining 2.7 kg, the patient was referred to an eating disorder partial hospitalization program.

Unfortunately, the patient was readmitted after she refused to eat, losing weight and refusing medication, leading to her arrest and remand to Juvenile Justice Center (JJC). She was readmitted to our pediatric hospital, where she was treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine to address anxiety. She received Lorazepam for anxiety during feedings via NG tube initially. Afterwards, she was readmitted to JJC for further treatment.

346,"Hospital Course:

The 19-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital in December 2017 with a recent diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. The patient presented with pharyngeal pain and a left neck mass with fever for 2 months. The patient received a tracheotomy because of airway obstruction resulting from a large mass arising from the left parapharyngeal space at a local clinic. PET/CT scan shows a large solid mass located in the left parapharyngeal space with compression of the pharyngeal cavity and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left neck. The histopathological review confirmed diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. 

Treatment and Management:

Chemotherapy was initially started with the aim of stabilization of the fulminate disease course; however, the lesions did not shrink and pain and dysphagia were heavier caused by the compression of the pharynx. In order to relieve the compression, irradiation to the lesions of pharyngeal and neck was started. After irradiation, the size of lesions became a little bit smaller.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue was performed and showed the presence of oncogenic mutations. The patient began to take a specific medication. After one month of treatment, a partial response was observed. The medication was continued for two months, however, the patient could no longer afford such an expensive drug. 

NGS was done again and the patient was treated with a medication that was more affordable. Two months after the treatment, excellent PR was observed compared with tumor size in March 2018. Four months later the re-evaluation showed a nearly complete remission.

The patient, a 48-year-old male with a history of syphilis and sickle cell trait, was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma with multiple lymphomatous polyposis. The patient underwent three cycles of R-Maxi CHOP and three cycles of R-High Dose-Ara-C with complete response. His PBSC were mobilized and harvested on his last cycle of R-High Dose Ara-C with G-CSF and plerixafor. Seven months after his diagnosis and two months after his last chemoimmunotherapy, he underwent the BeEAM protocol for an autologous HCT.

On day –8, the patient started the BeEAM protocol and received his first dose of intravenous bendamustine. From day –6, the patient's urine output, serum sodium, and serum creatinine started to increase. Forced diuresis with furosemide was stopped, and oral hydration was optimized. On day –1, the patient started complaining of polyuria, nocturia, and thirst. Despite the normal range of urine osmolality, a nephrology consultation team suspected nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) along with concomitant dehydration in absence of other identified causes of polyuria. A desmopressin challenge was administered intravenously and showed a 33% increase from baseline urine osmolality with a decrease in diuresis. The patient remained polyuric and highly dependent on fluids due to his hypernatremia. Intranasal desmopressin was started and increased until it reached 40 mcg twice daily intranasally. A brain MRI was then performed to rule out central lymphomatous infiltrates, which came back negative and reinforced a diagnosis of partial NDI. The patient's natremia returned to normal range along with decreased diuresis and intravenous dextrose 5% was stopped. Desmopressin was weaned off and then stopped.

481,"Medical History:
A six-year-old female boxer dog with a 13-month history of progressive and mildly pruritic skin lesions.

Admission Exam:
Physical examination of the dog revealed no abnormalities. On dermatological examination, nine ulcerated and nonulcerated skin nodules were observed, ranged from 1 to 7 cm in diameter, and distributed mainly over bony prominences of distal extremities and digits of the front legs, left elbow, and right hock. Other skin lesions included footpad hyperkeratosis, crusting, depigmentation, and erosions.

Diagnostic Tests:
Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology made from material obtained from nonulcerated skin nodules revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation and numerous mainly extracellular round-shaped organisms, ranging from 20 to 30 μm in diameter, most containing 2 spores of approximately 10 μm in diameter. A culture of FNA material in dermatophyte test medium (DTM) was performed, and smooth, creamy, yeast-like colonies were grown. Histopathology revealed nodular-to-diffuse, pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis.

Diagnosis:
Cutaneous protothecosis due to Prototheca wickerhamii was confirmed through sequencing of a portion of the 28S rRNA gene following DNA isolation.

Treatment:
The patient was treated with oral fluconazole, which resulted in significant clinical improvement in footpad lesions after one month of administration. However, the progression of skin nodules was not slowed with this treatment regimen. A protocol developed to treat canine cryptococcosis was then applied, which involved subcutaneous infusion of AMB and concurrent administration of itraconazole. Due to nephrotoxicity, AMB was discontinued after seven infusions, and the patient is presently receiving itraconazole alone.

Follow-Up:
Although skin nodules have not shown any improvement with this treatment regimen, footpads remain close to normal.",What were the findings of the diagnostic tests and how would you summarize the diagnosis of cutaneous protothecosis due to Prototheca wickerhamii in the discharge summary?,"The diagnostic tests revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation with extracellular round-shaped organisms and cultures of yeast-like colonies in DTM, confirming cutaneous protothecosis due to Prototheca wickerhamii through sequencing of a portion of the 28S rRNA gene.",Summarization

Patient: 8-month-old female Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Hospitalization dates: July 2015

Admission: The patient was brought to the veterinary clinic due to frequent and violent sneezing that began after a walk in a rural area.

Medical History: No antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory therapies were being administered to the dog.

Clinical Findings: The patient presented with stertorous and reversal sneezing. Laryngoscopy revealed everted laryngeal saccules, and posterior rhinoscopy showed small mucosal erosions surrounded by mildly thickened and oedematous mucosae in the rhinopharynx. Two and three whitish fusiform organisms were observed in the right and left nasal cavities, respectively. Attempts to catch them using endoscopic forceps failed, and only one was collected via nasal lavage. After rhinoscopy, the larva was identified as a first instar larval stage of O. ovis L. (Diptera: Oestridae).

Treatment: The patient was treated thrice every seven days (days 0, 7, and 14) with subcutaneous administration of ivermectin. Following nasal lavage, the acute and violent sneezing improved considerably. Subsequently, sneezing disappeared completely, and only moderate reversal sneezing remained present, probably due to everted laryngeal saccules.

Hospital Course:

Admission: The patient, a 79-year-old male, with a history of pancreatic pseudocyst secondary to idiopathic acute pancreatitis diagnosed two years ago, was admitted with severe acute gastrointestinal bleed presenting with melena and a hemoglobin level of 5.8 g/dL. The patient was admitted to the ICU for supportive care including pantoprazole infusion, blood transfusion, and close monitoring.

Assessment: CT scan of the abdomen revealed a complex pancreatic mass representing a bleeding pancreatic pseudocyst, which had increased in size when compared with the previous CT scans. EGD/EUS showed submucosal bulging likely from extrinsic compression on the proximal gastric body and fundus with a small clean-based ulcer on the top of this bulge. EUS confirmed the presence of anechoic lesion with hyperechoic shadowing suggestive of cyst/pseudocyst with bleeding located in the tail of the pancreas. The patient continued to have melena and a decrease in hemoglobin to 6.3 g/dL for which an additional two units of PRBCs were provided.

Intervention: Interventional Radiology was requested to perform a mesenteric angiogram with hope that it may help identify and control the source of bleeding; however, angiogram did not demonstrate any active bleeding vessel. Ultimately, the bleeding stopped spontaneously. The patient had another EGD/EUS which again noted two openings over the greater curvature of the stomach suggestive of fistulous communication of the lesion with the stomach lumen. A bullet-tipped catheter was inserted into the lumen, and aspiration showed blood consistent with hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst fistulizing into the stomach and causing severe upper gastrointestinal bleed.

Follow-up: Follow-up CT abdomen one year later revealed calcification in the head and uncinate process of pancreas along with scarring in the uncinate process, consistent with chronic pancreatitis. Additionally, the pseudocyst that was abutting the stomach wall had resolved.

Diagnosis: Pancreatic pseudocyst with bleeding and fistulous communication with the stomach.

Condition at Discharge: Stable.

Discharge Instructions: The patient is advised to follow up with a gastroenterologist and continue management of chronic pancreatitis. The patient is also instructed to monitor for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as melena, hematemesis, or general fatigue.

Patient Name: N/A
Date of Admission: N/A
Date of Discharge: N/A

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 53-year-old man, presented to our Department with a 2-month history of a painful and moderately swollen left wrist. Standard anteroposterior and lateral X-rays of his left wrist revealed two osteolytic lesions involving the distal ulna and the lunate fossa of the distal radius without any joint involvement. Subsequent biopsy of his left ulna under regional anesthesia produced brown spongy material, histologically characterized by the presence of large numbers of multinucleated giant cells and spindle cells in a dense collagenous background. These findings were histologically consistent with a diagnosis of Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) and correlation with the clinical and radiological findings was recommended by the pathologist. As he had no other skeletal manifestations, a complete resection of the distal ulna followed, along with curettage and cementoplasty of the distal radial metaphysis, to support the articular surface.

Two weeks postoperatively, he was re-admitted to our orthopedic department with diffuse musculoskeletal soreness, anorexia, constipation, nausea, and localized abdominal pain. He also reported weight loss of approximately 5 kg. On palpation, he had tenderness in the thoracic wall, the second and fifth metacarpals of his right hand, the left tibia, the pelvic ring, and the left shoulder girdle and humerus. Plain radiographs revealed multiple osteolytic lesions in his ribs, right hand, left tibia, and scapula. A histopathological examination of both the resected ulna and the curettings of the radius revealed similar findings: numerous, multinucleated, osteoclast-type giant cells were noted amid a mononuclear, spindle cell, histiocytoid component. Based on the similar findings of both lesions and the rarity of multifocal GCT of bone, the histopathology report included in the differential diagnosis a Bone Tumor of hyperparathyroidism, either primary or in the setting of a paraneoplastic PTH-like protein production and suggested further patient evaluation.

Our patient’s laboratory examination showed high total serum calcium, low serum phosphorus, and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) was suspected and confirmed by the elevated PTH levels. Serum potassium and sodium concentrations and thyroid hormone levels were in reference range, as well as the main cancer indicators. His human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was elevated. An isotope bone scan showed multiple sites of uptake over his ribs bilaterally, the lower pole of both scapulae, multiple foci in his pelvis, the metacarpal bones of his right hand, and his right tibia. At subsequent radiological work-up, both computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography of his neck revealed a mass emanating from the right lobe of his thyroid gland. Parathyroid subtraction technetium-99m (99mTc) sestamibi (MIBI) scintigraphy showed extensive uptake in his right lower parathyroid gland. Multiple endocrine neoplasia was excluded because of the normal MRI imaging of his pituitary gland.

Appropriate medical care was given to our patient including hyperhydration and high doses of diuretics and diphosphonates. After his health status improved and his serum calcium nearly normalized, a specialist surgeon was consulted for further surgical treatment. Surgery consisted of extensive resection: total thyroidectomy with removal of the parathyroid glands. A mass abutting the thyroid gland was documented at surgery. The mass was surrounded by a thick capsule, had a tan-brown, solid, and microcystic cut surface, and rubbery consistency. On histologic examination, the tumor comprised small cells with minimal to scanty cytoplasm and round nuclei, arranged in an organoid pattern, with frequent perivascular pseudorosettes. Thick fibrous septa emanating from the capsule were noted within the tumor. There was capsular invasion, with extension of neoplastic groups in the surrounding loose connective tissue adjacent to striated muscle, and foci of vascular invasion in the tumor capsule. The histologic findings were consistent with a parathyroid carcinoma. The neoplasm did not appear to invade the adjacent thyroid lobe and did not involve the margins of resection.

The patient experienced postoperatively persistent hypocalcemia requiring calcium and vitamin D replacement. His condition was characterized as “hungry bone syndrome.” He is now recovering 12 months after surgery, with a serum PTH level of 7.1 pg/mL and serum calcium level of 10.7 mg/dl and he is under calcium and vitamin D replacement therapy. The lytic bone lesions have almost disappeared, and no other additional orthopedic intervention is necessary. He is closely followed by general surgeons, oncologists, and endocrinologists.

Admission:

A 61-year-old male patient was admitted to the liver surgery department due to the discovery of a liver mass for 6 days. The initial alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was 1009 ng/ml, and liver contrast CT scan indicated hepatic cell cancer in the right lobe. The patient underwent an ALTPS surgery for the same.

Hospital Course:

In the postoperative days, the patient developed fever and abdominal pain and eventually experienced shock followed by hypoxia. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU where further examinations revealed WBC 0.63×109/L, PLT 7×109/L and PCT 45.88 ng/ml in addition to the presence of ascites. Doctors treated him with fluid resuscitation and norepinephrine (1.8 mcg/Kg.min) and managed the pathological fluid accumulation by culturing and draining the ascites which revealed the presence of Escherichia coli. The patient was placed on Imipenem and Vancomycin for treatment and subsequently underwent a second surgery to remove the right half of his liver as signs of necrosis were found in the CT scan. Over the next three days, he experienced significant improvements with no fever, reduced norepinephrine (0.4 mcg/Kg.min), and maintained urine output. However, on the 5th day, the patient experienced recurrent fever (>38.8°C), an increase in the norepinephrine to 2.0 mcg/Kg.min, and worsening of liver function, coagulation, and oxygenation. An arterial blood gas test showed pH 6.988, PaO2/FIO2 154, PaCO2 147.7mmHg, BE -19 mmol/L, and lactate 9.7 mmol/L. A critical care ultrasound was ordered to evaluate the patient's condition.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 29-year-old Asian male, was admitted to Xiamen Chang Gung Hospital after undergoing surgical debridement for a perianal abscess at another hospital. On admission, he presented with continuous severe perianal and scrotal pain, scrotal swelling, high fever, and was found to have extensive emphysema around the testicles, epididymis, and perineal subcutaneous tissues. A diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene (FG) complicating a perianal abscess was made, and the patient underwent aggressive fluid administration, hemodynamic support, and intravenous antibiotic therapy.

The patient received immediate surgical debridement under general anesthesia, leaving both testes exposed. Microorganisms were detected in tissue samples taken during the first two debridements. The patient received preoperative antibiotic treatment with combined broad-spectrum antibiotics, which was later adjusted to the culture sensitivity of the microbial isolates. The patient was subsequently administered levofloxacin, and his white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level gradually decreased. 

The patient underwent two subsequent surgical debridements, and his infection gradually subsided. His gas gangrene resolved completely, and good granulation tissue was present 1 week after surgery. Testicles were transpositioned into the scrotum on the eighth postoperative day, and split-skin closures and open drainage from the scrotum and perianal area were subsequently performed. The patient was discharged on the 11th postoperative day with antibiotics adjusted to oral administration of levofloxacin.

Follow-up:
The patient attended the outpatient department four times for follow-up. Both testicles healed, and the open drainage area from the scrotum and perianal area had healed at 10 months after discharge.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 71-year-old male with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, initially presented to our emergency department with nonspecific abdominal symptoms consistent with bloating and a feeling of abdominal enlargement. He had no history of neoplasms or previous abdominal examination. Following a computed tomography (CT) scan, the patient was referred to our clinic due to the detection of a tumor in the pancreatic head. On physical examination, the patient presented with a soft, non-tender abdomen without palpable masses, icterus, or lymphadenopathy. The patient’s vital signs, with the exception of some abnormal laboratory values, were within normal limits. An ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a tumor in the area between the neck and body of the pancreas. A contrast-enhanced CT showed an almost 3 cm round, well-defined and homogeneous tumor in the same location. A biopsy, histopathological, and immunohistochemical examination confirmed the diagnosis of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. The patient underwent pancreas resection and a 68gallium-DOTATOC positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan four months after the surgery did not show increased metabolic uptake.

Hospital Course:

On admission, the patient’s blood glucose was controlled with insulin glargine. On discharge, the patient’s most recent glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 8.7% and his diabetes medication was modified to a combination of insulin glargine, insulin glulisine, and metformin due to his elevated HbA1c reading.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 26-year-old right-handed white woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), was admitted to the hospital on [Redacted]. She was diagnosed with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) based on a surveillance MRI of her brain that showed asymmetric confluent non-enhancing hyperintensities in the bilateral subcortical precentral gyri consistent with PML. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) showed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for JC virus (JCV) and a diagnosis of PML was made based on compatible neuroimaging findings along with the presence of JCV DNA in the CSF. 

Treatment was initiated with orally administered mefloquine loading dose followed by 250 mg weekly and mirtazapine 15 mg daily. Repeat MRI after two months showed no changes in her brain lesions, but mild dysmetria of her left hand was noticed by the patient at three months after diagnosis. A repeat brain MRI revealed a few small enhancing lesions in her left frontal lobe suggestive of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). She was treated with intravenously administered immunoglobulin followed by high-dose methylprednisolone and restarted on glatiramer acetate for MS treatment.

Five months following the diagnosis, a repeat brain MRI showed interval development of T2 signal abnormality with mild enhancement in multiple areas including the brainstem, cerebellum, and bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Given the MRI findings, she was treated with high-dose intravenously administered methylprednisolone for a total of six courses until there was significant resolution of enhancement on her brain MRI. The patient was then transitioned from glatiramer acetate to ocrelizumab for MS treatment.

The patient was a 34-year-old Caucasian male who presented with chronic diarrhea due to norovirus infection. He had undergone intestinal transplantation twice in the past, with the second transplant being performed 18 months ago. The patient developed mild acute rejection in the colon, which was successfully treated with intravenous steroids. Follow-up biopsies were normal. The patient's chronic diarrhea persisted, and he was diagnosed with norovirus gastroenteritis two months later. Treatment with oral immunoglobulin did not result in improvement, and the norovirus infection continued. Four days after the end of the immunoglobulin treatment, the patient was readmitted to the hospital due to fever, increased diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Severe biopsy-proven rejection grade 2-3 was diagnosed in the small-bowel and colon. The acute rejection was treated with a 10-day course of intravenous antithymocyte globulin, which resolved both symptomatically and in graft biopsies. The patient was discharged with persistent signs of colitis and distal ileitis but has remained rejection-free now 10 months later. Nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily was started for the persistent norovirus infection, but without any clear clinical or virologic response. Bacterial, other viral, and parasitic samples were negative.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with severe thrombocytopenia in 1999 and underwent splenectomy. Following the procedure, the patient was prescribed a combination of immunosuppressant medications but continued to require frequent doses of intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids due to persistent severe thrombocytopenia. 
In April 2003, the patient experienced periodic oscillations in platelet count levels with a statistically significant period of 23 days. The patient frequently reported bleeding with oral mucosal blood blisters during episodes of severe thrombocytopenia. Despite the addition of danazol to the treatment regimen, the patient's platelet count levels remained unstable.
After six years, eltrombopag was introduced and led to extreme thrombocytosis. As a result, all immunosuppressant medications were stopped and the patient experienced a period of severe thrombocytopenia for approximately 4 weeks. Subsequently, eltrombopag was slowly reintroduced and the cyclical thrombocytopenia became less severe over time. At the last follow-up in May 2015, the patient was prescribed eltrombopag 75 mg daily along with low doses of azathioprine and mycophenolate.

Diagnosis:
Severe thrombocytopenia

Hospital Course:
76-year-old female patient was admitted with a complaint of shortness of breath when lying in the left lateral decubitus position. She had also experienced dyspnea after mild exercise for the past 9 months and a sense of abdominal fullness. The patient had an 8-year history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and severe Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR). 

Diagnostic Assessment:
The electrocardiogram showed AF with low fibrillatory wave amplitude. Echocardiography showed an enlarged right ventricular (RV) cavity and mild paradoxical motion of the ventricular septum. She had no L-R shunt disease. Computed tomography (CT) findings showed that the maximum size of the right atrium (RA) reached 121 mm with RA enlargement over time. 

Treatment:
Surgery was performed via median sternotomy using cardiopulmonary bypass and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography due to the thin pericardium and enlarged tricuspid valve annulus with no structural abnormality. Tricuspid annuloplasty was performed using a 28-mm Carpentier-Edwards Physio tricuspid annuloplasty ring. Plication of the enlarged RA was performed, mainly at the interatrial septum, the free RA wall, including the appendage, and the space between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid ring, in addition to the free RA wall, including the appendage. Additionally, closure of the left atrial appendage from the outside was performed to prevent left atrial thrombus formation. 

Recovery:
Post-operative course was uneventful. Postoperative X-ray and CT showed a reduced cardiac silhouette and RA volume, and postoperative echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 58% and mild TR with a pressure gradient of 29 mmHg. The patient’s symptoms were completely resolved, and she was discharged 3 weeks after surgery.

Patient: 62-year-old male

Admitted: with dyspnea and chest pain

Diagnosis: Cardiac tamponade caused by metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with pericardial effusion

Hospital Course: 

The patient was admitted with progressive dyspnea and chest pain. On examination, he had a heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure of 122/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and O2 saturation of 98% on room air. Heart sounds were muffled, and heart rhythm was irregularly irregular. Distention of the jugular veins was observed, and Kussmaul's sign was present. Although pulsus paradoxus was not observed, other physical findings were extremely concerning for cardiac tamponade. Bibasilar crackles were present on lung auscultation. Laboratory data was remarkable for a creatinine of 1.42 and INR of 3.6 (on warfarin for a history of pulmonary embolism). His electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and electrical alternans. Chest radiograph showed enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.

A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was obtained, which showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right ventricle, suggestive of cardiac tamponade, as well as mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction (see Figures and ). The patient's INR was reversed to <1.5, and he underwent emergent subxiphoid pericardial window with the removal of 700 ml of turbid, dark, bloody pericardial fluid. He had significant improvement in hemodynamics and respiratory distress. The pericardial fluid cytology and pericardial biopsy were both positive for malignancy, consistent with metastatic UC (see ).

One week after the pericardial window, the patient underwent a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which did not show evidence of metastatic disease elsewhere. Given the recurrence of UC with metastasis to the pericardium, he was started on atezolizumab. Subsequently, he was noted to have recurrent pericardial effusion suggesting failure of treatment (see ). He was then started on pemetrexed, a folate antimetabolite chemotherapy drug, for metastatic UC with plans to complete 6 cycles.

Recommendation:

The patient requires close follow-up with his oncology team to monitor response to treatment and recurrence. He should receive regular cardiovascular evaluations due to his history of cardiac tamponade. It is recommended that the patient be advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and follow-up with his healthcare provider as needed.

Admission Date: [redacted]
Discharge Date: [redacted]
Admitting Diagnosis: Right ovarian torsion with hemorrhagic cyst

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 16-year-old Caucasian female, presented to our hospital with acute pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, and tenderness approximately 30 hours after symptom onset. Direct abdominal X-ray images were normal, and tumor markers were within normal ranges. Preoperative abdominal US showed minimal pelvic fluid, an increase in diameter of the appendix, and a large right ovary with increased diameter relative to the left ovary, leading to the suspicion of right ovarian torsion.
During surgery, right ovarian torsion with a hemorrhagic cyst approximately 8 cm in diameter was detected. A cystectomy was performed to prevent retorsion, and the ovary was repaired. Aspiration was performed on contralateral ovarian cysts, and the appendix was deemed periappendicitis, leading to its removal. The patient had no complications during the postoperative period, and she was discharged on the fifth postoperative day.
After the surgery, the patient's ovaries were regularly checked using pelvic and Doppler imaging. In the fourth month, her affected ovary showed similar size and blood flow as the contralateral ovary, and her development was age appropriate. She continues to be followed up uneventfully and has regular menstrual cycles.

Reason for Admission:
A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of sicca syndrome, slight pain, and bilateral enlargement of parotid glands for 18 months. She also had progressive bilateral periorbital swelling.

Medical History:
The patient was diagnosed with Sjogren syndrome in 2015. She had a history of moderate asthma that required treatment with long-acting beta2 agents and inhaled steroids for a few years.

Physical Examination:
The physical examination revealed evident swelling of salivary and lacrimal glands, bilateral yellow eyelids xanthelasmas, and the presence of multiple intra-glandular lymph nodes. 

Diagnostic Tests:
The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed patchy diffuse salivary and lacrimal gland enlargement together with the presence of multiple intra-glandular lymph nodes. The high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest revealed a nodular lesion (diameter 3 cm) at the inferior right pulmonary lobe. The bronchoalveolar lavage did not show any pathogenic microorganisms or atypical cells. The endoscopic biopsy failed to obtain diagnostic material. The whole-body positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET-CT) showed a modest increase in fludeoxyglucose up-take of lymph nodes, parotid glands, and oral-rhino pharyngeal mucosa.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease based on the histological examination of an intra-parotid lymph node.

Treatment:
One cycle of 2 g rituximab (RTX) was administered together with methylprednisolone 100 mg single-shot premedication. The patient reported a rapid and complete improvement of exocrine glands swelling, and resolution of asthma. No chronic therapy was prescribed, and no adverse effects were observed.

Follow-up:
The remission persisted at the 12-months follow-up visit and was confirmed by MRI. Furthermore, neither the pulmonary lesion was visible at HRCT nor significant intra-thoracic 18FDG-uptake was detectable at PET control. IgG4-RD responder index stepped down from 14 to 6, serum IgG4 levels roughly halved, and plasmablasts concentration became undetectable.

Diagnosis: The patient suffered multisystem blunt trauma on the right side of her abdomen following a sports utility vehicle accident. She had a closed head injury, bilateral pulmonary contusions, and grade IV liver laceration. She also developed infected bile peritonitis that showed signs of severe sepsis.

Hospital Course:

The patient was observed in the ICU since she was vitally stable. Seven days after the initial injury, the patient’s abdomen became markedly distended, causing respiratory compromise requiring reintubation. Repeat computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a significant amount of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. An abdominal drain was inserted under US guidance, and several liters of bloody fluid and bile were removed.

Despite the drain, the patient went on to develop infected bile peritonitis, showing signs of severe sepsis requiring laparotomy and washout, as well as extensive abdominal drainage. Ten days after the laparotomy and four weeks after the initial injury, bile leak was persistent, and the patient underwent Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which demonstrated bile leakage from a left second biliary radicle. A transampullary stent was placed, and shortly thereafter, she improved dramatically.

However, thyroid retesting was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with primary congenital hypothyroidism due to high TSH and low free thyroxine levels. Levothyroxine sodium replacement therapy was immediately initiated, leading to improvement in bowel movements and resolution of abdominal distension. Laxative therapy was discontinued after six months of adequate LT4 therapy, leading to complete recovery without abdominal distension. At five years of age, the patient was euthyroid, with normal physical development and language communication, socially and emotionally well adjusted.

The deep tendon reflex was absent on both sides. Based on these findings, the patient's condition was graded as ASIA grade C. The NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) score was 6 on admission.

Enhanced computed tomography of the whole body and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of all spinal lesions revealed no abnormality, such as ossification, stenosis, a mass, or intramedullary signal changes. However, two days after admission, repeat MRI revealed a linear high signal intensity area on T2-weighted images in the ventral parts of the spinal cord at T3–T10. These areas were confined to the anterior horn in the axial plane. Diffusion-weighted MRI showed slight abnormality on day 5. Therefore, a diagnosis of spinal cord infarction manifesting as sulcal artery syndrome was made.

The patient was started on antihypertensive therapy and underwent intensive rehabilitation. After some time, her paralysis improved to the point that she was able to walk with the aid of a T-cane and catheter could be removed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:

Spinal cord infarction manifesting as sulcal artery syndrome due to thrombosed aortic dissection in the descending aorta (Stanford type B) and severe arteriosclerosis.

Hospital Course:

A 48-year-old male with no significant medical history was admitted with altered mental status. The patient was febrile with a holosystolic murmur on physical examination. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and mild hyponatremia. Imaging studies including CT head and MRI of the brain suggested a cardio-embolic source and the echocardiogram revealed a large mitral vegetation. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus agalactiae. Antibiotics were started empirically and later switched to penicillin and gentamicin. The patient was assessed by cardiothoracic surgery team but was deemed not a surgical candidate. The patient's condition remained stable but unchanged despite the administration of antibiotics. Repeat blood cultures remained negative. In the third week of hospitalization, the patient's mental status worsened, and he was found to have hemorrhagic transformation of embolic infarcts with moderate cerebral edema and midline shift. The patient was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring. The patient subsequently became unresponsive and was found to be in pulseless electrical activity. Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful, and the patient eventually expired.

The patient is a 4-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to respiratory tract infection, splenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia. Upon admission, the patient exhibited several distinct facial features, including low nasal bridge, prominent epicanthic fold, hypertelorism, and low-set ears. He also had congenital bilateral club feet and cryptorchidism, as well as delayed speech and motor development. Laboratory tests indicated an abnormal increase of white blood cell count and hypochromic anemia. A bone marrow aspiration smear revealed trilineage myelodysplasia and decreased platelet production from megakaryocyte, leading to the diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).

The patient was treated with supportive care, including transfusions and antibiotics for infections. Unfortunately, the patient died before chemotherapy could be started and bone marrow transplantation performed.

Assessment and Plan:

Whole-exome sequencing of the patient's peripheral blood DNA revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (c.34G > A, p.Gly12Ser) in the KRAS gene, which could be categorized as pathogenic. Sanger sequencing was applied to confirm the mutation. The parental blood sample and patient's buccal swab sample were analyzed and determined that the KRAS mutation was absent, indicating the presence of a somatic mutation. A pathogenic deletion encompassing 7311 kb in size was also detected, involving OMIM genes, including NRG3, CDHR1, RGR, LDB3, BMPR1A, and GLUD1.

HOSPITAL COURSE

The patient is a 52-year-old farmer who was admitted to our hospital after being involved in a high-velocity road traffic accident. Upon arrival, he was conscious and his vital signs were within normal limits. He had a history of segmental myoclonus which had been treated prior to the accident. Radiographic examination revealed multiple fractures including a left-sided posterior acetabular wall fracture, an ipsilateral femoral neck fracture with the femoral head displaced anteriorly, a middle-third fracture of the shaft of the femur, and an extra-articular distal femur fracture on the opposite side.

The patient underwent definitive surgery 9 hours after arrival, during which the fractures were fixed using various methods including trochanteric flip osteotomy, contoured reconstruction plates, antegrade femoral nail, and tension band wire. Three days following the initial surgery, the contralateral distal femur fracture was addressed using a titanium locking plate. The postoperative period was uneventful.

Three weeks after the initial surgeries, the patient experienced an episode of rhythmic contractions of the lower limbs at home and presented to us with an anterior dislocation of the left hip joint. An open surgery was performed to reduce the left hip joint. The patient was on follow-up treatment with a neurologist to manage the myoclonus problem.

Four weeks after the surgery to relocate the femoral head, non-weight-bearing mobilization was initiated. Unfortunately, avascular necrosis of the femoral head occurred. At this point, we waited for union of the femoral shaft to occur before pursuing any further treatment.

Eight months after the initial surgery and after union of the femoral shaft fracture, the patient underwent total hip replacement surgery. An uncemented hydroxyapatite-coated stem was used for the femur and a ceramic on polybearing surface was used. Postoperatively, there was no shortening of the limb. Immediate full weight-bearing mobilization was started using walker support.

One year following the hip replacement surgery and 22 months following the initial trauma, the patient was ambulatory without any support and able to do all activities with an LEFS (lower extremity functional score) of 72. The radiographs showed complete union of all the fractures and there was no loosening of the femoral prosthesis.

DISCHARGE INFORMATION

The patient was discharged in stable condition and with no acute issues. Appropriate wound care instructions were given. Physical therapy discharge instructions were also provided. The patient was advised to continue with follow-up treatment with their neurologist to manage myoclonus. The patient is to follow up with their orthopedic surgeon for routine follow-up care. 

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS

The patient was advised to continue taking their current medications per medical provider instructions. They were also advised to avoid strenuous activities until cleared by a medical provider. The patient was informed about the importance of continued physical therapy and follow-up appointments with their medical providers. They were instructed to report any concerning symptoms including fever, increased pain, shortness of breath, or discharge from the surgical site. The patient was also advised to call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department if they experience any acute medical problems.","What were the patient's injuries and subsequent surgeries, and what was their functional status at the time of discharge according to the discharge summary?","The patient had multiple fractures, including a left-sided posterior acetabular wall fracture, an ipsilateral femoral neck fracture with the femoral head displaced anteriorly, a middle-third fracture of the shaft of the femur, and an extra-articular distal femur fracture on the opposite side.

A 34-year-old female was admitted due to refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension headaches caused by a radiographically confirmed anterior dural tear at T10-T12. Multiple epidural blood patch placements totaling six were attempted over a three-month period, which failed to alleviate the symptoms. A CT-guided percutaneous epidural placement of a synthetic absorbable sealant was planned due to the severity of headaches and their disabling effect on the patient's quality of life. The placement of the hydrogel sealant was successful with minor complications. The patient experienced severe localized back pain towards the end of the target injectate volume. Soon after, the patient was discharged home with instructions and oxycodone for pain control. Later that day, she was admitted again for pain control and observation due to unremitting back pain. The MRI of the spine showed hydrogel sealant material impression on the right dorsolateral surface of the spinal cord at the T10-T11 level with normal cord signal. The patient subsequently developed signs and symptoms consistent with a concordant right-sided dermatomal thoracic neuralgia, presumably due to mass effect on the lower thoracic spinal nerve roots, but did not demonstrate any myelopathy. She was started on gabapentin, amitriptyline, and oxycodone for breakthrough pain and continued to receive treatment for four months before returning to work. Five months after the procedure, the patient remained headache-free, but she continued to suffer from chronic mild thoracic neuralgia. Her neuropathic symptoms steadily improved and were well controlled with topiramate, amitriptyline, and as needed tramadol.

Admitting Diagnosis: Huge cervical fibroid presenting with acute urinary retention

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of lower abdominal pain and inability to pass urine. On evaluation, a huge mass was found arising from the cervix and occupying the whole pelvis. An ultrasound and MRI pelvis revealed a mass of 15 cm × 15 cm with typical whorled appearance which was arising from the cervix and lower uterine body. The uterus was normal sized and was placed just above the cervical fibroid giving it a typical “Lantern of St Paul’s dome” appearance. The patient also had mild bilateral hydroureters and hydronephrosis. Her kidney function test and urine analysis were unremarkable. Urine culture didn’t show any growth.

In view of the complication of obstructive uropathy due to huge cervical fibroid & her parity, the patient underwent abdominal myomectomy. On laparotomy, a large central cervical fibroid measuring 15 cm x 15 cm x 9 cm was seen impacted in the pelvis and displacing the uterus upwards. After careful delineation of the surrounding structures and bladder dissection, successful intra-capsular enucleation of cervical fibroid was done. There were no intra-operative complications and the patient stood the surgery well.

Postoperative ultrasound showed resolution of bilateral hydronephrosis. The patient's hemoglobin was optimized to 12 gm/dl prior to discharge from the hospital.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS) based on clinical and laboratory findings.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to diplopia and balance disorders, which were followed by ascending paresthesias and severe tetraparesis. A cerebrospinal fluid study was normal, but IgM to Mycoplasma Pneumoniae and IgG anti-GQ1b antibodies were detected. Two MRIs of the brain were normal. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) but worsened and needed mechanical ventilation. A second IVIg course was started, and the patient began to improve. A third IVIg course was administered, and the patient's muscle strength recovered, except in the right upper limb, with mild gait ataxia.

Serial Conduction Studies:
Four serial conduction studies were performed during the hospital course, which revealed undetectable or very reduced compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) with slightly prolonged distal motor latencies (DML) and slow motor conduction velocities (MCVs). Sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) showed reduced amplitudes. On day 72, distal CMAPs increased, and partial conduction blocks (CBs) emerged in intermediate nerve segments of both median and ulnar nerves.

The patient is a 24-year-old, obese male with a history of Goodpasture syndrome, bilateral ground glass opacities, and bihilar lymphadenopathy. The patient also experienced acute kidney failure, septic shock, metabolic-toxicity, and possibly medication-induced delirium. The patient was intubated with mechanical ventilatory support and underwent testicular sperm extraction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Upon admission, the patient presented with a 2-week history of bloody sputum, progressive dyspnea, urine of light pink color, and fever. He had a long duration car travel prior to his complaints. Bilateral ground glass opacities and bihilar lymphadenopathy were documented on CT scan. An empirical antibiotic regime with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin was started. Oxygenation deteriorated rapidly under non-invasive ventilation, and the patient had to be intubated. Positive results for anti-GBM with a high titer of 151 E/ml confirmed the diagnosis of Goodpasture syndrome, which led to therapy with steroids, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide. A testicular sperm extraction was performed according to the patient's presumed wish to reproduce in the future. The patient received immediate chemotherapy, a step down regimen of corticosteroids adapted to anti-GBM value, as well as daily plasmapheresis for a total of 14 days. Following initial therapy, acute kidney failure developed with the need for continuous hemodialysis. A septic shock following a non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia required a specific antibiotic therapy as well as terminal ileum resection with ileostomy, subtotal colectomy, and Hartmann procedure. A dilative tracheotomy was performed due to an unsuccessful attempt to wean the patient from mechanical ventilatory support. The patient recovered from the acute illness with successful removal of the tracheal cannula but ongoing need for renal replacement therapy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Goodpasture syndrome, acute renal failure, septic shock, non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia, metabolic-toxicity, and possibly medication-induced delirium.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient should receive a low dosage of steroids (prednisone 5 mg/day) as part of the control for Goodpasture syndrome. Close monitoring of anti-GBM antibodies (actually 14 E/ml) is necessary.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to blurred vision in his right eye for 1 year. He was diagnosed with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) in the left eye 10 years prior, which was treated with argon laser photocoagulation. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye revealed retinal detachment accompanied with yellowish, fibrinoid exudative lesions in the temporal macula. An ophthalmic B scan confirmed bullous retinal detachment in the right eye, while fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) disclosed multiple intense sub-retinal leakage in areas corresponding to exudative lesion and in the superior retina. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed large amounts of sub-retinal fluid (SRF) in the macular and temporal retinal areas.

Treatment:
The patient received a 50% dose of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) with three spots in the right eye under the guidance of indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Ophthalmic B scan disclosed reduction in bullous retinal detachment 1 month after PDT, and the patient's BCVA improved to 20/25. Although the OCT image revealed a reduction in sub-retinal fibrin, the SRF remained and resolved slowly until the second month after PDT. Therefore, the patient received a second 50% dose of verteporfin PDT in the right eye with a spot size of 5000 μm under the guidance of ICGA. One month after the second PDT, ophthalmoscopy of the right eye revealed the disappearance of the yellowish, fibrinoid exudative lesions. Additionally, the reattached retina was observed on B-scan, and SRF in the temporal area markedly decreased in the OCT image.

Patient: 9-year-old female
Diagnosis: Partial physeal arrest
Procedures: Closed-wedge osteotomy, external fixation device, distraction osteogenesis, gradual lengthening, physeal bar resection

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of wrist pain and an unsightly appearance of the right wrist, which developed after sustaining a growth plate fracture of the right distal radius (Salter-Harris type II) that was treated with cast immobilization following a closed reduction. The patient was diagnosed with partial physeal arrest, with significant growth remaining. A two-stage procedure was planned to remove the physeal bar with the Langenskiöld procedure after gradual lengthening with distraction osteogenesis.

In the first operation, closed-wedge osteotomy was used to correct the distal radius, and lengthening was initiated using an external fixator. Computer models of the bilateral radius and ulna were created before the operation. After the computer modeling, the operation was performed with great precision. The external fixator was removed when adequate maturation of the callus at the bone interval and complete correction of the deformities were confirmed through plain radiographs.

In the second operation, PBR was performed using patient-specific guides as described previously. After the procedure, the affected limb was immobilized for 2 weeks. The patient had 2 years of follow-up, during which no recurrence of the wrist deformities was observed, and the patient did not complain of any pain and restrictions in motion.

Patient: 43-year-old male professional golf player

Diagnosis: Primary coxarthritis with unilateral Tönnis grade 3, treated with short cementless MiniHip™ stem and fourth generation ceramic on ceramic (CoC) surface.

Hospital Course: The patient underwent an otherwise uneventful primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with a short cementless MiniHip™ stem under epidural hypotensive anesthesia. Preoperative planning and the Woolson method were used to calculate limb lengthening. Postoperative rehabilitation protocol consisted of early weight-bearing as tolerated with crutches during the first 2 postoperative weeks. Noncontact sports were allowed after the 3rd postoperative month and contact sports were allowed but not recommended after 6 months. However, the patient began to practice soccer at 4 months of follow-up.

Current Issue: Around the 8th month of follow-up and without a history of trauma, the patient started complaining about progressive pain referred on the anterior thigh. Pain could only be partially alleviated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and protected weight-bearing. Radiographs showed a lateral cortical hypertrophy and periosteal reaction located at zones 2, 3, 8 and 9 of Gruen's classification in anteroposterior and lateral views, respectively, without any signs of subsidence or loosening. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed marked intraosseous oedema around the tip of the stem as well as around the periprosthetic subfascial soft tissues. Additionally, bone scintigraphy displayed an increased bone turnover at the distal part of the lateral periprosthetic cortical within the three phases of tracer uptake, suggesting a stress fracture.

Treatment: An articular aspirate and a bone biopsy of the affected zone were performed to rule out periprosthetic infection and osteomyelitis. Culture results were negative for infection, and pathology analysis revealed areas of osteoclastic resorption nearby haversian canals as well as areas of bone formation with abundant capillaries, increased subperiosteal osteoblastic activity, and periosteal thickening. A revision arthroplasty was initially scheduled, but pain decreased progressively after the biopsy was developed and the patient commenced to protect weight-bearing, until it disappeared at 1-year follow-up. Therefore, a new surgical procedure was dismissed.

The patient presented to the surgery outpatient department with complaints of odynophagia and chest pain for two weeks. The symptoms had started after a meal when the patient felt the sensation of a foreign body in the throat, which he reportedly swallowed with a bolus of food. The initial evaluation with neck and chest X-rays was reported as normal, and so he did not receive any specific intervention. However, in the third week after ingestion, he developed chest pain and fever. On evaluation with a contrast-enhanced thorax, chest, and abdomen scan, he was diagnosed with a right-sided pleural effusion and a suspected foreign body in the periesophageal region of the lower thoracic esophagus close to the inferior vena cava. An intercostal drain was placed under image guidance, and approximately 750 mL of serosanguinous pleural effusion was drained.

Subsequent upper gastrointestinal contrast study and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy did not reveal any signs of recent perforation or a foreign body in the esophagus. Laparoscopic foreign body removal was done under general anesthesia in the supine split leg position. The foreign body was successfully extracted from the lower thoracic esophagus, and a thorough mediastinal lavage was given.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on the fifth postoperative day.

Patient Name: N/A
Sex: Female
Age: 45
Date of Discharge: N/A

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to our hospital with multiple lung nodules and a history of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and central neck lymph node dissection, which revealed capsular invasion and extensive vascular space invasion.

After histological examination of the primary thyroid tumor and lung nodules, the diagnosis was revised to a biphasic malignant tumor consisting of both carcinoma and sarcoma components. The thyroid carcinoma component was positive for thyroglobulin, PAX8, and TTF1, whereas the sarcoma component was positive for vimentin and myogenin.

The patient received chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy. However, her thyroglobulin levels rose, suggesting a progression of the disease. A right thoracotomy and right lung resection/metastasectomy were performed, with negative surgical margins. Nevertheless, the patient's general condition deteriorated, and she succumbed to the disease four months later.

Findings:
The lung nodules showed similar tumor morphology and differentiation as the original thyroid tumor. Mutational analysis revealed the presence of a point mutation in DICER1 (E1705K), which has been associated with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

Other mutations detected in the tumor included FLCN (R239H), POLD1 (Q684H), and SYK (R217L), which have unclear prognostic and therapeutic significance in this context.

Conclusion:
The patient had a complex clinical history, with multiple lung nodules and a biphasic malignant thyroid carcinoma. Despite treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, leading to her passing four months after surgical intervention. Further studies are needed to understand the significance of the genetic mutations identified.","What was the diagnosis and treatment course summary for the patient with a complex clinical history, including multiple lung nodules and a biphasic malignant thyroid carcinoma, as reported in the discharge summary?","The patient's diagnosis was revised to a biphasic malignant tumor consisting of both carcinoma and sarcoma components.

The 7-year-old male patient was referred to the clinic from Lobos in Buenos Aires, Argentina for evaluation of intellectual disability, severe speech delay, and convulsive seizures. The patient presented with earlobe features that are characteristic of MWS. Previous testing included a 15p11.2-q13 methylation test, which was normal. This patient was initially diagnosed with ALS during infancy when typical phenotypic features were not clearly present.

Diagnostic Tests:
Blood samples were extracted from the patient and subjected to DNA extraction and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the whole exomes. To identify the germ-line variants present within the NGS data, which consisted of the sequences of the exons within the ZEB2 gene (GRCh37/hg19 chr2:g.145141048:145282747) and the adjacent intronic regions ( ± 10 bp), a proprietary bioinformatics analysis was performed. The analysis identified a novel pathogenic truncation variant (NP_055610.1: p.Ser726TyrfsTer7) of the ZEB2 gene in patient 1 that was not present in unrelated healthy controls that were obtained from the exome sequence databases ExAc Browser and gnomAD Browser. CNVs that were identified from the WES data were verified by a comparative genomics hybridization (CGH) array.

Diagnosis:
The subsequent analysis revealed that the patient has MWS caused by the novel truncation variant. No pathogenic mutations were found in other genes in the patient that are known to be associated with ALS, confirming the diagnosis of MWS.

Treatment:
The patient was managed with supportive care, which included occupational and speech therapy to improve intellectual disability and speech delay. Anticonvulsant therapy was initiated to control convulsive seizures.

Follow-up:
The patient will be followed up regularly by the clinic to monitor the progression of symptoms and response to therapy.

Patient: 76-year-old male with hypertension and deep vein thrombosis

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the oncology clinic in June 2016 after routine blood work revealed low white blood cell and platelet counts. A bone marrow biopsy showed normocellular marrow with no evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome. He was treated with steroids but did not respond. In February 2017, blood tests showed further decreases in blood cell counts, and a second bone marrow biopsy in March 2017 revealed 20.8% blasts with hypercellular bone marrow. Therefore, he was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

Treatment:

The patient received the standard first-line induction chemotherapy regimen of cytarabine and daunorubicin in March 2017 but showed no response in the subsequent bone marrow biopsy performed 14 days after chemotherapy initiation. In view of his refractory AML, he chose not to undergo re-induction attempts involving intensive chemotherapy. He was offered salvage chemotherapy with the less-toxic AZA, which he agreed to. The subsequent bone marrow biopsy performed in April 2017 showed a positive response, and subsequently, he received nine more cycles of AZA.

The patient is a 17-year-old male who presented with mild hemoptysis after sustaining a blunt trauma to the chest. He fell off a 3-foot cliff while hiking and landed on the right side of his chest. On examination, he had minimal abrasions, ecchymosis, and tenderness over the right lower chest wall. A chest X-ray obtained within 2 hours of the trauma showed alveolar opacities in the right lower lobe with multiple cystic air spaces containing air-fluid levels. A CT scan of the chest showed thick-walled multicystic lesions with patchy air space opacities and consolidations in the right lower lobe, suggestive of CPAM with superimposed bleeding.
 
The patient was admitted for observation and evaluation and placed on intravenous Amoxicillin/Clavulanate. Spirometry done the next day was normal. His complete blood count, basic metabolic panel and bleeding profile were normal. His C-reactive protein was elevated. Gram stain, acid fast stain, and sputum cultures for bacteria, fungi, and tuberculosis were all negative. Alpha-1 antitrypsin and immunoglobulin levels were within normal limits.

Consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon was done, and a right lower lobectomy was being considered. However, given the indolent course of his disease and his negative history for pulmonary infections thus far, the patient elected to defer further surgical evaluation and, instead, follow-up with clinical observation. He remained asymptomatic throughout the interval period and a chest X-ray repeated after one year was normal. Finally, a CT scan of the chest obtained two years later showed complete resolution of the previously described abnormalities. Due to the fact that his cysts resolved spontaneously with time after his trauma, the patient was finally diagnosed with TPP.

Arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and tobacco smoking. The patient had a history of clinical tuberculosis in childhood. He underwent local resection and weekly intravesical instillation of BCG (BCG-MEDAC) in 2015 to treat bladder cancer.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a 7 kg weight loss and nocturnal low-grade fever. A thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computerized tomography scan revealed pulmonary embolism, a sub-renal septic aneurysm, and a collection in the right psoas muscle. 18FDG PET/CT scan showed intense hypermetabolism of the aortic aneurysm. During physical examination, the patient complained of dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain. Hemoglobin concentration was found to be low at 10.8 g/dL, while lymphocytes were 0.7 G/L and C-reactive protein was 60 mg/L. Surgery revealed a rupture on the right flank of the aorta, which explained the psoas hematoma. Routine bacteriological investigations remained negative, but pathological examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation of the vascular wall, leading to a differential diagnosis of BCG aneurysm. Combining rpoBMTC-FISH and Ziehl-Neelsen-staining allowed for specific detection of mycobacteria. Tazocillin was discontinued, and an anti-tuberculous treatment, which included ethambutol and a combination of isoniazid and rifampicin, was continued for two months.

Patient:
A 71-year-old Qatari male

Diagnosis:
Oral cavity Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
Stage cT4 N0 M0

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital on the 12th of January 2017 for a second-line treatment with nivolumab. The treatment was started after declining chemotherapy due to post-radiation necrosis and neck fistula experienced in previous treatments.

Tests and Investigations:
Two CT scans of the patient neck were taken before treatment and 10 days after the fifth cycle of the treatment. PET CT scan was carried out 239 days after the fifth cycle (7 months, 25 days) of treatment. The antibody response to the NY-ESO-1 antigen was measured in the plasma using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a known immunogenic NY-ESO-1 peptide. The cellular response to the NY-ESO-1 antigen was investigated in patient’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production by T cells against the NY-ESO-1 overlapping peptides. Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of PD-1 in the patient CD3+ T cells before and after nivolumab treatment. A panel of 27 plasma biomarkers (cytokines and chemokines) was analyzed by multiplex analysis.

Medical History:
The patient was diagnosed with oral HNSCC and underwent radiotherapy in London, UK in 1997 with a recurrence of the cancer in 2016 involving the supraglottic region and tongue base.

Clinical Findings:

Patient n.1 is a 66-year-old male with diabetes type I, associated diabetic retinopathy, and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The patient presented with increasing irritating symptoms of eye discomfort, described as burning, itchiness, and feeling sand in his eyes, scored as OSDI (Ocular Surface Disease Index) of 65 out of 100, with a VAS (Visual Analogue Score) score of pain of 74 mm out of 100 and no difference between eyes. After being unsuccessfully treated with standard tear substitutes, a compassionate unconventional therapy with CBS eye drops was administered for two months.

A significant relief from subjective symptoms of discomfort, such as burning, itchiness, and feeling sand in his eyes, was reported in September 2016. OSDI score and VAS score were significantly reduced. The visual field tests performed since 2014 were analyzed and showed a significant lowering in MD values followed by an amelioration in association with the period of treatment with CBS.

Due to the combination of persistent hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions, serum and urine electrophoresis were performed to rule out the possibility of multiple myeloma, both which were negative.

Progress Note:
To exclude hematologic malignancy, a bone marrow biopsy at the left iliac crest was performed. Bone marrow pathology revealed atypical lymphocytes that stained positive for the CD20 marker, which is consistent with B-cell lymphoma (BCL) involving the bone marrow. Immunophenotyping of bone marrow cells further supported the diagnosis of BCL, with the population testing positive for CD45, CD19, CD20, CD79a, and HLA-DR. 

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent a complete diagnostic workup to find any hidden malignancy. A thin-slice chest CT and abdominopelvic CT scans were unremarkable. Additionally, a torso PET-CT scan showed no abnormal FDG uptake. The patient was diagnosed with a rare case of primary bone marrow DLBCL.

Admitting Diagnosis: Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with progressively worsening abdominal pain and constipation. Physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness and a hypogastric mass. A CT scan showed the presence of 3 contiguous and communicating cystic formations, localized at the level of the mesentery, and some other similar lesions. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, and a voluminous cystic mass composed of 3 confluent formations, with a major axis equal to about 10 cm, was observed and removed. Scar adhesions due to previous nephrectomy hampered the procedure.

Postoperatively, on the 8th day, the patient developed a circumscribed peritonitis due to dehiscence of the ileoileal anastomosis. Another operation was performed to resect the anastomotic site. A delayed return of normal bowel function was resolved through prokinetic therapy with levosulpiride and neostigmine methylsulfate.

Upon histological examination, the mass was found to be benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma. The patient was discharged 33 days after the first operation in good condition.

Follow-up:
The patient was free of symptoms at 8 months follow-up.

Chief Complaint: Perforated left cornea

Hospital Course:
The patient was referred to our facility with a perforated left cornea and a history of non-penetrating left eye injury. He had a corneal scar and poor vision due to the injury caused by a bamboo plant. He also had poorly controlled hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus. On the first visit, his left eye was found to have a descemetocele with microleakage. Uneventful corneal gluing with a bandage contact lens was performed. The patient was discharged home with moxifloxacin and lubricant eye drops, atropine eye drops, ciprofloxacin tablets, and acetazolamide tablets. During the follow-up period, the patient's clinical condition was stable until he complained of visual loss. He was readmitted for amniotic membrane transplantation because of suspected microleakage. Unfortunately, the AMT was unsuccessful, and further corneal perforations were observed. A second graft was performed, which eventually led to corneal cross-linking to strengthen corneal integrity. At the end of the hospital course, no further corneal melting was observed. The patient's eye was saved from enucleation or evisceration.

Diagnosis:
Perforated left cornea due to non-penetrating left eye injury

Plan:
The patient received prophylactic antibiotics and antifungal medications, amniotic membrane transplantation, and corneal grafts. He was provided with medications and discharged home with a plan to attend diabetes clinic visits and follow up with ophthalmology. The patient had a good response to the treatment and was eventually discharged with no further complications.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 62-year-old woman, presented to our institution with abdominal pain in October 2011. She was diagnosed with carcinosarcoma with high-grade serous adenocarcinoma component associated with high-grade endometrial sarcoma in the right ovary and fallopian tube, with peritoneal implants in the upper abdomen and pelvis.

From April through June 2012, the patient received adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel for four cycles, followed by intraperitoneal cisplatin and intravenous and intraperitoneal paclitaxel for six additional cycles. She received tamoxifen as maintenance treatment for 4 months and was observed off treatment for 6 months. In May 2013, retroperitoneal adenopathy was discovered following a serial rise in CA125, which prompted radiographic assessment. She received carboplatin, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, and bevacizumab for four cycles and had a partial response. 

From April 2014 through December 2015, the patient received various treatments for platinum-resistant disease. Pemetrexed, nab-paclitaxel, megestrol, capecitabine, and vinorelbine were administered. Despite the extensive pretreatment, she remained largely asymptomatic and had a good performance status. However, owing to disease progression, she initiated treatment with pembrolizumab in January 2016. After the fourth cycle, PET/CT showed objective partial response in the left external iliac lymph nodes, as well as in the right-posterior pectoral lymph node conglomerate. Another major site of metastatic disease was the right retropulmonary lymph nodes. 

The patient underwent radiotherapy with the goal of increasing local control and potentially causing an abscopal effect. She then received an additional four cycles of pembrolizumab. Unfortunately, disease progression was discovered in the liver shortly thereafter. She received olaparib for 2 months but without response, and she died in October 2016.","What were the patient's diagnosis and treatment plan outlined in the given discharge summary about carcinosarcoma with high-grade serous adenocarcinoma component associated with high-grade endometrial sarcoma in the right ovary and fallopian tube, with peritoneal implants in the upper abdomen and pelvis?","The patient was diagnosed with carcinosarcoma with high-grade serous adenocarcinoma component associated with high-grade endometrial sarcoma in the right ovary and fallopian tube, with peritoneal implants in the upper abdomen and pelvis.

Hospital Course:
A 9-year-old girl was referred to the Department of Endodontics of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León for the evaluation of a mandibular first molar. The medical history was noncontributory. The dental history revealed a root canal treatment had been performed 6 months ago on tooth # 36, and a stainless steel crown was subsequently placed. During the clinical examination, the tooth had a painful response to the percussion and was nonresponsive to the pulp vitality test. Periodontal probing was within the normal limits. A radiographic examination revealed a previous endodontic treatment, periradicular radiolucency, and open apices in the mesial root. The clinical diagnosis was a previously endodontically treated tooth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, and endodontic retreatment in conjunction with an apexification technique was indicated. At the first appointment, after administration of local anesthesia with 2% mepivacaine (a local anesthetic), the tooth was isolated with a rubber dam. The stainless steel crown was removed, and access cavity was performed under a dental microscope. The root canal filling was removed from all the canals with Hedstrom and K3XF files (endodontic files). The working length was established based on radiographs and K-files (endodontic files). The instrumentation and irrigation were performed with K3XF files and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCL). Calcium hydroxide was used as an intracanal medicament. At the second appointment (after 6 weeks), the patient was asymptomatic. The canals were irrigated with NaOCL and 17% EDTA. An MTA (a dental cement) apical barrier of 4 mm was placed only in the mesial canals, and a moist cotton pellet was used to ensure the setting of the material. Calcium hydroxide was applied in the distal canal. At the third appointment (after 3 days), the presence of a firm barrier of the MTA was assessed using a K-file. The distal canal and the remainder of the mesial canals were obturated with lateral compaction technique using gutta-percha and AH Plus sealer (a dental sealer) (Figure B). The access cavity was closed temporarily with IRM (a dental material) at the end of all treatment appointments. Finally, a definitive restoration was indicated.

Follow-Up and Discharge:
Clinical examination follow-ups were performed at 16 and 24 months. In both follow-ups, the patient was asymptomatic. In addition, resolution of periradicular radiolucency and continued root development were observed. At 24 months, a cone-beam computed tomography scan was performed. An approximate measure of the continued additional root development was obtained using the manufacturer's software.

The patient received emergency surgical intervention, namely, right-sided wide decompressive craniectomy with extensive trauma incision. An aspiration of approximately 50 cc of purulent material from the abscess and an aspiration of a 15 cc collection from the parenchymal mass were performed. Postoperative imaging studies confirmed the success of the decompression procedure.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
The pathological diagnosis confirmed that the abscess contained numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes without bacteria at gram staining, and that cultures were positive for Achromobacter denitrificans, but negative for anaerobic bacteria or fungi. The isolate was susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tigecycline, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. However, despite receiving subsequent antibiotic therapy, the patient's neurological condition deteriorated in the postoperative period.

Outcome:
The patient's Glasgow Coma Score remained at 3 during his hospital course, and unfortunately, the patient passed away on the postoperative day 9.

Follow-up:
The option of genetic testing was discussed with the family, and an appropriate referral was made to a genetic counselor.

Patient: 69-year-old male

Admission date: [date]

Discharge date: [date]

Hospital course:

The patient was referred to the Medical Imaging Department for a virtual colonoscopy after a positive fecal occult blood test. The patient had mild chronic diarrhea that worsened due to metformin. The initial rectoscopy was normal, but the sigmoidoscopy was stopped due to pain caused by a spastic diverticular sigmoid. As the patient was taking clopidrogel (Plavix) for ischemic heart disease, a total optical colonoscopy was not conducted due to a relative contraindication. During the automated low-pressure colonic insufflation with carbon dioxide, the insufflator stopped repeatedly, indicating a colonic stenosis or obstacle. A complete cut-off of the inflated colon was observed on a CT topogram at the level of the sigmoid and descending colonic junction.

Diagnostic findings:

A short contrast-enhancing “scar-like” intra- and extraparietal structure was seen infiltrating the posterior colonic wall at the level of the sigmoid and descending colonic junction. This curvilinear retractile “scar-like” tissue had developed multiple adherences with the retroperitoneum and the left iliac fossa and seemed to be stapling the colon on the retroperitoneum. Ultrasound study showed a thickening of the muscle layer at the junction of the sigmoid and descending colon, demonstrating a centripetal retractile convergence of the muscle layers to an intraparietal very hyperechoic and very attenuating scar. Classical colonic opacification on the next day confirmed a complete retrograde and unidirectional stenosis. Gross anatomy of the resected colonic segment confirmed a short stricture constituted by corbelling fibrosis infiltrating the colonic wall of a diverticular segment. Histology showed typical fibrosis with discrete chronic inflammatory infiltrates and lymphoid clusters. Few microabscesses related to chronic diverticulitis were also found.

Treatment:

After a discussion with the multidisciplinary staff, a celioscopic resection of the stenotic segment was proposed to protect the patient from prograde occlusion. The celioscopic resection was difficult due to retroperitoneal and left ureteral adherences, so a classical laparotomy became necessary. The postoperative period was uneventful. Four months later, the patient underwent a ceolioscopic right hemicolectomy for a small adenocarcinoma of the caecum that was not visible on the CT.

Follow-up:

The patient was discharged on [date]. The multidisciplinary staff recommended the patient for follow-up with the gastroenterologic staff to complete the study of the proximal colon which had not been studied. The patient was advised to discontinue clopidrogel (Plavix). A comprehensive medical evaluation was recommended with the gastroenterologist.

History and Findings:
The patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian man who was admitted with an enlarged prostate and urinary retention. Pelvic ultrasonography confirmed a prostate volume of 158 cc. The patient underwent Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). During the procedure, a damaged lens in the nephroscope resulted in an extremely poor cystoscopic image. A 3.5-MHz convex abdominal transducer was used under B-mode ultrasound to view the bladder and guide morcellation. The enucleated adenoma was seen in the dependent portion of the distended bladder with both the nephroscope and Piranha morcellator just entering the bladder neck. Transurethral morcellation was initiated with the Wolf Piranha Scope and the Piranha morcellator at the manufacturer's recommended settings.

Treatment and Outcome:
With guidance from the ultrasound probe, the operator successfully aimed the morcellator tip in the direction of the enucleated adenoma and safely removed it from the walls of the bladder. A final inspection with both ultrasound and a functional cystoscope lens confirmed no remaining adenoma pieces within the prostatic fossa and bladder. The patient was discharged from the hospital the next day and experienced an uneventful postoperative recovery. Pathology analysis demonstrated a specimen weight of 69 g of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).

Medical Record Number: [Insert Number] 

This hospital course summary documents the medical events that took place during the admission period of the patient. The patient was a 47-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a complaint of generalized weakness and fatigue. The symptoms had developed over the course of two weeks and hindered the patient's ability to walk without assistance. The patient provided no history of chest pain, dyspnea, altered bowel habits, previous syncopal episodes, headaches, dizziness, or prior substance abuse.

The patient was started on a course of oral prednisone for bilateral anterior uveitis. In the course of evaluation, the patient was found to have severe hypotension and admitted to the medical floor. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids, norepinephrine, hydrocortisone, and tazobactam/piperacillin. Initial laboratory investigations showed an elevated total leukocyte count with neutrophilia. 

The patient underwent an extensive workup to determine the cause of his hypotension and generalized weakness. An initial diagnosis of septic shock was ruled out. The possibility of sarcoidosis was initially considered but ruled out due to the patient's quick deterioration and lack of response to corticosteroid therapy.

A presumptive diagnosis of Addison crisis was made due to the history of steroid use. The diagnosis was supported by inappropriately low cortisol levels and low ACTH levels. Further evaluation showed an enlarged right adrenal gland with a heterogeneous hyperdense area. A smaller heterogeneous lesion was present in the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland. A CT scan showed the presence of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage.

The patient did not present with classical features of adrenal insufficiency. Serum sodium and potassium levels were mildly low. Low ACTH could be attributed to prior prednisone therapy supplemented with hydrocortisone. A possibility of panhypopituitarism was ruled out, and euthyroid sick syndrome explained low TSH, T3, and T4 levels obtained when the patient was critically ill.

Some of the possible causes of adrenal hemorrhage were ruled out, including sepsis, antiphospholipid syndrome, abdominal trauma, and bleeding diathesis. No consensus was reached on the etiology of the adrenal hemorrhage.

The patient's condition worsened despite vigorous treatment, and he was transferred to the ICU and intubated. The patient subsequently developed bradycardia, which led to an asystolic rhythm. Despite performing CPR for 25 minutes, the patient could not be revived, and care was ultimately withdrawn.

In conclusion, this hospital course summary documents the evaluation and management of a patient with hypotension and generalized weakness. The patient's condition was complicated by bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, and a presumptive diagnosis of Addison crisis was made. The patient's condition deteriorated despite aggressive treatment, ultimately leading to cardiac arrest and withdrawal of care.","What is a brief summary of the evaluation and management of a patient with hypotension and generalized weakness, as well as their complicated course due to bilateral adrenal hemorrhage leading to a presumptive diagnosis of Addison crisis?","The discharge summary documents the evaluation and management of a 47-year-old male patient with hypotension and generalized weakness, complicated by bilateral adrenal hemorrhage leading to a presumptive diagnosis of Addison crisis.

The 50-year-old female patient with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery performed six years ago presented with epigastric pain, nausea, and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding of nine months duration. Despite multiple upper and lower GI endoscopies, and a video capsule endoscopy, the source of her bleeding remained unidentified. CT scan of the abdomen showed an obstructing mass at the pylorus with marked distention of the gastric remnant and a small soft tissue nodule suspicious for peritoneal metastatic disease. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging further demonstrated hypermetabolism within the gastric pylorus mass, but no evidence of metastatic disease. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed wall thickening of the excluded stomach at the antrum, and two enlarged lymph nodes. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lymph nodes and the gastric wall of the excluded stomach revealed poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. The biopsy did not detect H. pylori infection, and molecular analysis showed a HER2-negative tumor. Staging laparoscopy confirmed peritoneal implants. The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for Stage IV gastric cancer with capecitabine, plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX).

Summary of Findings:
The patient's condition is significant for bleeding of the gastrointestinal tract, attributed to recurrent obstruction caused by poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. Abdominal CT scan and PET/CT imaging showed an obstructing soft tissue mass in the pylorus with fluid-filled gastric remnant distention and a small suspicious soft tissue nodule anterior to the gastric antrum. EUS detected diffuse wall thickening of the excluded stomach at the antrum and two enlarged lymph nodes. FNA biopsy of the lymph nodes and the gastric wall of the excluded stomach revealed poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. The biopsy did not detect H. pylori infection, and molecular analysis showed a HER2-negative tumor. The patient underwent staging laparoscopy which confirmed peritoneal implants.

Hospital Course:
This is a discharge summary for a 63-year-old male patient who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) due to pancreatic head cancer. The patient underwent two courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (GEM) and S-1 for 6 months preoperatively based on the protocol of clinical research (Japan Adjuvant Study Group of Pancreatic Cancer 04 study). Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as poorly differentiated, tubular adenocarcinoma, with pT2, N0, pStage IB according to the UICC classification, seventh edition. After the surgery, he received adjuvant S-1 therapy.

Three months after the PD, blood tests showed coagulation derangements with high C-reactive protein (CRP 11.30 mg/dl). Computed tomography scan (CT) revealed a 55-mm mass alongside the transverse colon. During 2 weeks of follow-up, the coagulation derangement and elevated CRP (17.66 mg/dl) persisted. Repeat CT showed that the tumor enlarged to 65 mm, and an additional mass, 25 mm in diameter, was detected in the jejunum. He was hospitalized due to abdominal pain and diarrhea with persistent high fever and was inspected; however, there was no evidence for infections.

The patient underwent an emergency surgical intervention for large and small bowel metastasis from resected pancreatic cancer. Extirpation of the tumors combined with partial resection of the transverse colon and the jejunum was performed on the eighth day of hospitalization. Immediately after the emergency surgery, the fever resolved and the CRP level normalized. He was discharged and received nab-paclitaxel with GEM chemotherapy for 2 months postoperatively. The patient selected for best supportive care after this. The patient died due to a relapse with mesenteric lymph node metastasis 7 months after the emergency surgery (13 months after the first surgery).

In conclusion, the emergency surgical intervention was successful in providing relief from the symptoms caused by the underlying malignancy, and the patient was able to return home. While there were few reports about metachronous intestinal metastases after PC surgery, in oncological emergencies, surgical intervention is expected to improve patient’s quality of life. Based on the advancement of multimodality treatments, such as chemotherapy, in the recent years, even metastatic lesions from PC would turn to be resectable in some cases. Therefore, surgical resection should be considered for large and small bowel metastasis from resected PC in selected patients.","Can you provide a brief summary of the patient's emergency surgical intervention and the subsequent treatment for intestinal metastases from resected pancreatic cancer, as described in the discharge summary?","The patient underwent an emergency surgical intervention for large and small bowel metastasis from resected pancreatic cancer.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with a 2-week history of dyspnea and leg edema. He had a medical history of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and angina. The patient underwent living-donor kidney transplantation from his wife 7 years prior to admission and had been undergoing peritoneal dialysis. After transplantation, the patient was able to discontinue dialysis and had stable renal function. A few months before admission, the patient's blood pressure control deteriorated, and the patient experienced acute deterioration in renal function after taking angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

On admission, the patient had a regular pulse rate, bilateral pitting edema in the limbs, and wheezing in the chest. The patient's blood pressure was 166/71 mmHg, body temperature was 36.8°C, and oxygen saturation was 93% without oxygen administration. The laboratory findings showed an acute exacerbation of renal function and an elevation of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level.

Electrocardiography revealed a strain pattern, and echocardiography revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy as well as moderate aortic stenosis. Magnetic resonance angiography showed the bending and narrowing of the transplant renal artery, and ultrasound examination also revealed stenosis in the transplant renal artery.

Intravascular ultrasonography revealed shrinkage of the vessel in the stenotic area, likely the anastomosis site. After pre-dilation using a 4-mm balloon, implantation of a 6-mm self-expandable stent and post-dilatation with a 5-mm balloon were performed sequentially. Although moderate stenosis was observed angiographically, further dilation was not deemed feasible as it could have increased the risk of vessel dissection or perforation because the lesion might be at the anastomosis site.

After the procedure, the patient's peak systolic velocity in the stenosed part dropped, renal function, and blood pressure control improved, resulting in the preservation of graft function. Antihypertensive medication could be significantly reduced.

Discharge Status:

The patient was discharged with improved renal function and reduced antihypertensive medication.

Follow-up:

Follow-up angiography was conducted 4 months later, demonstrating no restenosis observed and the pressure gradient had dropped. Surgery was deemed successful, and the patient was discharged with instructions for follow-up monitoring of kidney function.","What was the patient's admission and discharge diagnosis, and can you summarize the key procedures and findings related to their hospital course, according to the provided discharge summary?","The patient's admission diagnosis was acute congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema, and their discharge diagnosis was transplant renal artery stenosis.

The patient, a 25-year-old waitress, was admitted to Gulu Regional Referral and Teaching Hospital in February 2017. She was found unconscious and had a severe headache, with no history of convulsions, fever, or visual disturbances. The patient had a past medical history of HIV infection, diagnosed in November of 2016 following an admission at GRRTH for an acute illness.

DIAGNOSES:

The patient was diagnosed with a recurrence of Cryptococcal meningitis (CM). CSF analysis confirmed the clinical diagnosis. Serum and CSF point-of-care lateral flow assays were both positive for Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg). The patient also had a CD4 count of 79 cells/μL.

TREATMENT:

Although amphotericin B was “out-of-stock,” the patient was treated with high-dose (1200mg) fluconazole, as flucytosine was not available in Uganda. The patient received daily therapeutic lumbar punctures over 72 hours for the management of her assumed increased intracranial pressure. The fluconazole dose was reduced to 800mg daily as per the national CM treatment guidelines. The patient was also initiated on antiretroviral therapy.

DISCHARGE:

The patient was discharged and transferred for further care at Arua Regional Referral Hospital, as her brother requested. She comes from Packwach, West Nile, and was not aware of the cause, treatment options, and the need for long-term/life-long suppression therapy for her condition. The patient was not able to take care of her basic needs while in the hospital and mostly relied on the support of good Samaritans and other patient's caretakers for food and support.

The 5-year old female was admitted with progressive deterioration in her motor and mental function. Her previous medical history was unremarkable, with no obvious signs of illness up to 2.5 years of age. However, from the age of 2.5 years, after suffering a little finger injury, the patient exhibited a gradual loss of speech and communication abilities. At 3.5 years she developed stereotypic movements. MRI revealed diffuse white matter lesions and hypoplasia of the lower cerebellar vermis. A diagnosis of Rett syndrome was initially suggested, but subsequent tests failed to reveal any abnormalities. At 5 years 8 months, the patient was admitted with a severe deterioration in her motor and mental function.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with no interest in environment, no play activity, absence of orientation in space and time, and disturbed speech and understanding of speech. Her condition further deteriorated, leading to myoclonus in her hands, legs and facial muscles. Tactile stimulation was found to enhance the myoclonus. The patient was unable to walk, stand, or crawl, only able to hold her head, roll over, and sit with periodic falls. An ophthalmological assessment revealed partial atrophy of optic nerves, nistagmus, retinitis pigmentosa and mixed astigmatism. An EEG revealed a significant delay in the formation of cortical electrogenesis and poorly-structured epileptiform activity. MRI revealed cortical atrophy, periventricular leukopathy of both hemispheres of the brain and atrophy of the cerebellum. An ECG showed severe sinus bradyarrhythmia and a variable heart rate.

Discharge Diagnosis:
The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of progressive neurological disease, with no specific known etiology.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital following 2 days of lightheadedness, abdominal pain, and melena. He had a past medical history of hypertension and erosive gastritis that required transfusion. Two weeks prior at a nearby academic medical center, he was diagnosed with an unidentified mass at the head of the pancreas and prescribed prednisone 20 mg PO b.i.d. Along with diltiazem and tramadol, the patient was compliant with his medications. Upon arrival, the patient was hypertensive with a blood pressure of 175/39 mm Hg and a pulse of 140. On examination, the patient was found to have significant epigastric tenderness without rebound. Melena was also present during rectal examination. Diagnostic tests revealed leukocytosis, a reduced hemoglobin level, and significantly elevated platelets. The patient received fluid resuscitation after becoming hypotensive during hospital day 1. The hemoglobin level subsequently decreased from 9.2 to 7.8 mg/dL. The patient's steroid therapy was discontinued due to concerns about diagnostic clarity and veracity of the AIP diagnosis in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding.

During hospital day 2, the patient continued to experience abdominal pain and had another episode of melena that required transfusion without vital sign abnormalities. Diagnostic tests showed a reduction in leukocyte count and platelets as a result of discontinuation of steroid therapy. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on hospital day 3, which revealed multiple erosions and an ulcer in the duodenal bulb, erosive gastritis in various regions of the stomach, and grade 2+ gastric varices and grade 1+ nonbleeding varices in the esophagus. Ultrasound with Doppler studies showed moderate splenic enlargement but patency of the splenic, hepatic, and portal veins. Melena persisted throughout hospital days 4 to 7, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 7, tolerating a full diet, and started on a suite of medications including pantoprazole, prednisone 20 mg PO b.i.d., propranolol, sucralfate, and tramadol which was to be taken as required for abdominal pain.

Final Diagnosis:
The patient presented with lightheadedness, abdominal pain, and melena. Diagnostic testing revealed leukocytosis, reduced hemoglobin levels, and significantly elevated platelet counts. His previous AIP diagnosis was being reassessed due to gastrointestinal bleeding.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our institution after being referred due to an ultrasound finding of ascites and a pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) scan that showed thickening of the gastric walls, multiple omental nodules, and ascites. The patient underwent further diagnostic examinations, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, which returned negative results for cancer.
During her hospital stay, the patient underwent a comprehensive metabolic profile and tumour markers assessment. Increased levels of CA125 were detected, whereas carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19.9, and other immunohistochemical markers were within normal ranges. Serological assessments for HIV, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus were negative.
A biopsy was performed on the patient, resulting in a diagnosis of suspicious carcinoma from an unknown primary site. However, two weeks later, the patient received a CT scan of the thorax that showed a spontaneous reduction in size and number of peritoneal lesions, as well as resolution of peri-hepatic and peri-splenic ascites.
To further exclude malignancy, the patient underwent a laparoscopic surgery, which showed no evidence of the presence of malignant cells. Instead, the final pathological diagnosis reported necrotising inflammation caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria.
The patient was subsequently transferred to a hospital with expertise in infectious diseases. A follow-up CT scan performed one year later confirmed complete recovery of peritoneal findings.

Sex: Male  
Date of Admission: [REDACTED]  
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]  

Medical History: Unknown  

Hospital Course:  
The patient was admitted to our hospital with a suspected left parotid gland cancer. The patient complained of a painless nodule in the left parotid region that had increased in size over the past two years. FNA cytology was performed, revealing clusters of epithelial cells with a sheet-like arrangement and high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. Malignant epithelial cells derived from salivary glands were suspected. An MRI showed a well-defined multilocular tumor located close to the outside of the left parotid gland. The patient underwent tumor resection of the left parotid region and superficial parotidectomy, and the cut surface showed a well-defined lobulated tumor containing yellowish-muddy materials.

Diagnostic Findings:  
Histopathological examination revealed the resected tumor to be a proliferating pilomatricoma composed of basophilic cells and shadow cells apart from the left parotid gland. The tumor was encapsulated by fibrous tissue without stromal invasion. Focal squamous metaplasia, coagulative necrosis and apoptotic cells were also observed. Eosinophilic-stained shadow cells showed nuclear concentration and disappearance, and transitional histological findings were identified.

Immunohistochemical examination showed that basophilic cells and shadow cells were negative for anti-pan cytokeratin antibody and high-molecular-weight keratin, but squamous metaplastic cells were positive. β-catenin was positive for basophilic cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. Ki-67 labeling index for basophilic cells was 46.2% and 0% for shadow cells. The p53 labeling index was 94.8% for basophilic cells and 0% for shadow cells. S-100 protein, HMB-45, and Ber-EP4 were negative for basophilic cells and shadow cells.

Diagnosis:  
Based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical examination results, the patient was diagnosed with a proliferating pilomatricoma.

Treatment:  
The patient underwent tumor resection of the left parotid region and superficial parotidectomy.

Discharge Diagnosis:  Large muscular ventricular septal defect

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the emergency department following a frontal car collision. He sustained severe blunt trauma, which included cervical subcutaneous emphysema, bilateral pulmonary contusion, left hemothorax, pneumomediastinum, and complex fractures of both femurs. The patient was in hemorrhagic shock and was immediately taken to the operatory room. After stabilizing his hemodynamics and external fixation of both femurs, he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

The following morning, a loud holosystolic murmur was noted, and later a transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram showed a large muscular ventricular septal defect located in the mid anteroseptal segment. A cardiac catheterization confirmed the defect with limited hemodynamic repercussion. The patient was released after recovering from orthopedic surgery and was reevaluated three months later, which showed that the shunt had increased significantly.

A percutaneous procedure to close the ventricular septal defect was performed under general anesthesia and guided by transesophageal echocardiography. LV angiogram after the procedure revealed a mild residual shunt, and a transesophageal echocardiography was repeated a month after the procedure, which showed that the device was well adapted to the defect. However, a residual shunt remained in the superior border of the device.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient presented with a progressive eruption of cutaneous papules and nodules. The medical history reported nodules/papules on the hands 7 years before, for which she successfully received prednisone in the Philippines with only a few residual lesions. Recently, over a course of 2 months, she noticed an increasing number of cutaneous nodules and papules; starting on her hands subsequently spreading to her wrists and forearms. Pain arose from these nodules when bumped onto a surface.

The patient also suffered from pain and stiffness in hands, feet, elbows, shoulders and knees. Over these 2 months she felt increasingly tired. Apart from these symptoms, a few patches of grouped, flat, red/brown papules were seen on the inner side of the upper arms, on the hips, thighs and neck.

During the patient's hospital course, numerous firm, either reddish-brown or skin-colored papules and nodules were seen and felt mainly on the hands and forearms, varying in size from 0.5 to 1 cm. In addition, papules were found in pre-existing scars on the left shoulder and both knees. On clinical examination, pain was present on palpitation of many of the small hand joints, wrists, elbows and knees. Arthritis was present in several PIPs and in the wrist. Furthermore, her face appeared to be swollen. Laboratory examination revealed a normal level of ESR, negative ANA and anti-CCP antibodies and the IgM Rheumatoid factor was borderline positive.

Punch biopsies were taken from the nodules on the hands and from the plaque on the upper arm. Initially, a histological pattern of dermal scarring/fibrosis was found, without histological features of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. However, additional biopsies showed CD-68 positive macrophages and eosinophilic granulocytes between the collagen fibers in the dermis, in agreement with a form of non-Langerhans histiocytosis.

The PET/CT scan revealed FDG-avidity in the muscles of the thighs and buttocks, the corresponding points were painful to the touch according to our patient. Also, painful joints showed slightly more uptake when compared to the representative opposite joints.

The therapy consisted of prednisone, methotrexate and risedronate together with folic acid and calcium/vitamin D. Prednisone was started on 30 mg and tapered to 7.5 mg in 9 weeks. Methotrexate was introduced to a final dosage of 25 mg/week over 8 weeks. Risedronate was chosen as bisphosphonates are considered to be of additional benefit in the treatment of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. After 8 weeks of therapy, the joint pain had subsided and our patient was better able to move without pain. The skin lesions, however, persisted over these first 2 months of therapy.

Malignancy became very unlikely after laboratory tests, ultrasound of the abdomen, mammography, PET/CT scan and an additional MRI scan for further imaging of suspicious lesions in one of the mammae.

Reason for Admission:
The patient was referred to our clinic for the prediagnosis of retinal vascular occlusion. He reported low vision after a traffic accident in childhood and had a history of various ocular treatments.

Hospital Course:
Upon examination and testing, our team identified straightening of the temporal retinal vascular arcades, macular dragging, and partially treated nonperfused areas in the temporal retina with persistent NVE in the right eye. Laser therapy to the nonperfused areas was recommended to treat the NVE. Optical coherence tomography revealed disrupted macular contour associated with an epiretinal membrane in the right macula and minimal perifoveal thinning in the left macula.

Suspecting FEVR, the patient's brother was invited for an ophthalmologic examination. The brother also showed straightening of the temporal vascular arcades in both eyes and excessive vascular branching, nonperfusing cord vessels in the peripheral vasculature, as well as temporal avascular areas. Based on the revised Pendergast and Trese classification, the patient was diagnosed with stage 2A FEVR, and the brother was diagnosed with stage 1A FEVR.

Medical History:
The patient was admitted to the emergency room with left buttock pain. The patient had a history of being a hepatitis B virus carrier. There was no remarkable medical history except for two weeks of left buttock pain.

Hospital Course:
The patient had a generalized fever up to 37.8°C, and tenderness and swelling on the left buttock and proximal area of the posterior thigh. Plain radiography showed no evidence of fracture around her hip joint. The emergency medicine physician had a clinical impression of early stage cellulitis or contusion of the hip. The patient was discharged with empirical antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.

One week later, the patient visited the orthopedic outpatient department with aggravated pain and weakness on her left lower extremity. A patchy erythematous rash with sharp pain existed on the left buttock and posterior thigh without any sign of vesicle formation. The blood laboratory test showed mildly elevated CRP and normal procalcitonin levels. Lumbosacral MRI was urgently performed. The MRI revealed mild bulging disc with bilateral facet arthritis at L4-5 level which was not thought to be the direct cause of the symptoms. The result of EMG-NCV tests showed severe left sciatic neuropathy that no motor nerve responses from the left peroneal nerve and reduced compound muscle action potential on the tibial nerve were found. Pelvis MRI with contrast enhancement revealed asymmetrical diffuse swelling of the left sciatic and femoral nerve, which suggested neuritis. Herpes zoster infection of the left buttock three years ago was discovered in thorough systematic review. The putative diagnosis of herpes zoster was confirmed by detecting VZV DNA in her blood sample using the polymerase chain reaction test. 

Treatment:
The patient was treated with famciclovir 500 mg every eight hours and 20 mg/day of prednisolone for two weeks and changed to oral pregabalin 75 mg every 12 hours thereafter. After 12 weeks of an inpatient rehabilitation admission, the patient had a partial neurological recovery and could walk with a foot drop splint. The manual muscle test showed that muscular strength of her left ankle dorsi-flexor, plantar-flexor, and great toe extensor improved to grades II, III, and III, respectively. The hypoesthesia of S1 dermatome was completely recovered, while L4, L5 dermatomes showed 50% improvement. The skin rash and pain around it were completely alleviated.

Follow-up:
Follow-up pelvis MRI taken at 10 weeks after the treatment showed markedly diminished swelling of the left sciatic and femoral nerve. 

Summary:
The patient had a history of being a hepatitis B virus carrier, which was not related to the current symptoms. She had left buttock pain for two weeks until she slipped down on her way to the bathroom. The patient was diagnosed with early stage cellulitis or contusion of the hip, and a week after she was diagnosed with severe left sciatic neuropathy. After a thorough investigation, S1 dermatome had completely recovered, while L4 and L5 dermatomes improved by 50%. The patient was treated with famciclovir 500 mg, prednisolone 20mg, and oral pregabalin 75mg. She had a partial neurological recovery after 12 weeks of inpatient rehabilitation.

Clinical Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with no known comorbidities who recently gave birth to a healthy girl child. She was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset weakness of both upper and lower limbs, which progressed rapidly to quadriplegia. She had bilateral facial palsy and bulbar palsy. She was diagnosed with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) due to idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination. The patient was treated with sodium correction and pulse methylprednisolone and discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 0.

One year later, the patient presented to the neurology department with generalized fatigue, diffuse myalgias, and rapidly progressive weakness of all four limbs, which made her wheelchair-bound one day before the presentation. Clinical examination revealed pure motor flaccid symmetric quadriparesis with proximal more than distal weakness and generalized hyporeflexia. Nerve conduction studies showed reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of bilateral tibial and peroneal nerves with absent F waves and H reflexes. The patient was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) or hypokalemia-related electrophysiological abnormalities. Basic metabolic panel revealed severe hypokalemia, and arterial blood gas (ABG) and 24-hour urine analysis showed metabolic acidosis, consistent with renal tubular acidosis type-1 (distal). Autoimmune workup was positive for anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies, and minor salivary gland biopsy was pathognomonic. The patient was diagnosed with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) according to the new classification criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).

Hospital Course:
The patient was given intravenous (IV) potassium supplementation and subsequently shifted to oral liquid formulation. Oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation was given for renal tubular acidosis. With potassium correction, there was a rapid recovery in the power of all four limbs within 24 hours of admission. The patient was initiated on oral prednisolone and referred to a rheumatologist for further management. She remained asymptomatic on her six-month follow-up.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure and diagnosed with hypoplastic left lung syndrome. The patient underwent a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology, pediatric surgery, pulmonology, and neonatology for her management. The patient underwent a trial of different ventilator modalities with a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a course of dexamethasone, but it did not result in any improvement. Due to the futility of these efforts and the severe ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch in her left lung, a decision was made to trial left main bronchial plugging. 

The patient received an inflatable 5Fr bronchial blocker and underwent left bronchial blocker placement. This resulted in an immediate improvement of the patient's respiratory status with a decrease in oxygen requirement and improved ventilation with weaning of ventilator settings and better inflation of the right lung. The patient underwent surgical exploration by anterolateral thoracotomy, 80% of the emphysematous left upper lobe was removed, a small area of the pulmonary sequestration was also identified, and a chest tube was placed. The procedure was successful, and the patient's respiratory support was weaned as tolerated.

Hospital Course
The patient was admitted to our facility for generalized seizures with no previous acute symptoms. He had a personal history of ureterovesical junction obstruction and mild hydronephrosis. The patient had an episode of seizures about two months prior to admission and was undergoing chronic therapy with sodium valproate (Depakine). A brain MRI performed at that time was normal. The family history revealed ageusia and anosmia in both parents.

Upon admission, the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated, as he developed severe respiratory distress and pallor. The laboratory tests revealed anemia, a severely increased number of monocytes, and a mildly increased C-reactive protein. After taking into account the family history, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, which tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed consolidation in the lower lobe of the left lung associated with an opacity in the right apex, indicating the possibility of atelectasis.

The patient was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of severe COVID-19. The medical team initiated antibiotic treatment, antiviral therapy, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and antipyretics, and continued the chronic anticonvulsant therapy with sodium valproate. However, the patient’s condition deteriorated progressively, and he developed desaturation and bradycardia. The laboratory tests showed leucopenia, neutropenia, mildly increased creatin kinase, a high ferritin level, hypoalbuminemia, a prolonged time of prothrombin, and an increased international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient passed away on the fourth day of admission despite all efforts to resuscitate him.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Date of Admission: [REDACTED]
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted to the Respiratory Disease Unit at the University Hospital for a 6-month exertional dyspnea and bilateral pleural effusion that was prevalent on the right side, detected on chest computed tomography (CT). The patient underwent a series of procedures, including thoracic ultrasound, medical thoracoscopy, and surgical pleural biopsy, to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

Hospital Course:
The patient had a complex hospital course, with multiple diagnostic tests and procedures performed during the hospital stay. Initially, a repeated CT scan was conducted, which ruled out a pulmonary embolism but confirmed moderate right pleural effusion with parietal and visceral pleural thickening, in the absence of significant parenchymal abnormalities. Subsequent thoracentesis was performed, and the fluid was consistent with exudate. However, the microbiological tests, including an acid-alcohol-fast bacilli (AAFB) search, were negative. The patient subsequently underwent a medical thoracoscopy, which revealed a large lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, fibrosis, reactive mesothelial cells, and vascular proliferation, suggestive for non-specific pleuritis (NSP). The patient was treated with steroids and showed clinical and radiological improvement.

Six months later, the patient complained of chest discomfort and mild dyspnea, and a relapse of a small amount of right pleural effusion associated with diffuse pleural thickening was detected through a CT scan. The patient was referred to the Thoracic Surgery Unit of Sant’ Andrea University Hospital (Rome) for a surgical pleural biopsy, which revealed a diffuse fibrosing pleuritis, with hyaline features, fibrinous exudate, and a dense lymphocytic and plasma cell inflammation. Immunoperoxidase stains showed a marked increase of IgG4 positive plasma cells, with high IgG4 serum levels. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related pleuritis. Steroid therapy was promptly initiated, with complete resolution of pleural effusion, improved respiratory symptoms, and the progressive reduction of IgG4 serum levels.

Diagnosis and Condition:
The final diagnosis was IgG4-related pleuritis. The patient's condition improved with steroid therapy, and the discharge was approved.

The lesion was first described on the prenatal ultrasound at 30 weeks of gestation, and the patient was delivered by cesarean section due to fetal distress but was otherwise normal at birth. Development was normal, and there was no relevant family history. 

Upon physical examination, a 25/10 mm nodule was found on the antero-intern side of the left thigh that was firm, mobile and within the deep layers. The initial X-ray and ultrasound showed a pre-femoral soft tissue mass that measured approximately 30/13 mm, with nonhomogeneous structure, hypoechoic areas, calcifications, and weak Doppler signal, being located anteriorly to the vascular elements of the thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass of 19.33/15.19/34 mm, with a nonspecific vascular involvement.

Elective surgery was scheduled, and an italic S-shaped incision on the antero-internal face of the left thigh was performed. The tumor was resected, and the sartorius muscle was resected at a distance of about 2 cm distal and proximal to the tumor, with complete tumor resection. The patient had a favorable surgical outcome and was discharged 3 days postoperatively.

Diagnostic Findings:

Histologically, the mass in the sartorius muscle was noted as a proliferation of tapered cells arranged in an irregular spiral pattern and crossed by thin-walled vessels. A pseudocapsule formed by a thin layer of connective tissue <1 mm covered the mass. Neoplastic proliferation encompassed residual skeletal muscle fibers in the center of the lesion. Extracapsular and peripheral scarce mature adipose tissue were seen with isolated large-caliber blood vessels. 

Immunostaining revealed the following results: vimentin positive, smooth muscle actin positive in nodules with necrosis and calcifications (miotic nodules), desmin focal positive, Ki67 low (about 5 positive cells per 100 tumor cells, suggesting low cell kinetics).

Diagnosis:

A diagnosis of IM of left sartorius muscle was made.

He received noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy, as well as empiric antibiotics, for an ARDS of unknown etiology.

After 3 days of steroid pulse therapy, the patient significantly improved and was eventually discharged without any symptoms of dyspnea. The steroid was gradually tapered down and discontinued after 7 months.

However, the patient was readmitted in 10 months due to a relapse of dyspnea along with grasping pain in both thighs, proximal muscle weakness in extremities, and elevation of serum creatinine kinase. Imaging tests showed a mixture of diffuse ground-glass opacification and consolidation similar to previous roentgenological patterns. Although the Euroline myositis line blot assay showed negative results for either myositis-specific or myositis-associated antibodies, the short-tau inversion recovery sequence (STIR) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed inflammatory changes in both hamstring muscles.

Admitting Diagnosis: Chronic persistent swallowing dysfunction

History: The patient has a history of excessive intake of alcohol and locally grown tobacco use for several years.

Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital due to chronic persistent swallowing dysfunction for six months. White light endoscopy revealed a 22 mm flat lesion in the middle esophagus. The lesion was covered with scattered leukoplakia and normal vascular network could not be seen in the lesion. The patient received narrow-band imaging (NBI) under endoscopy which revealed the lesion with an indistinct brownish area, local white penniform area and white tiny papillary surface structure. Further low and high magnifying endoscopy with NBI (ME-NBI) showed tiny irregular papillary microsurface structure with various shapes and sizes, and non-typical intraepithelial papillary capillary loops (IPCL) confined to the papillary microsurface structure. Iodine staining endoscopy showed a less-stained lesion and showed more distinct white tiny papillary surface structure than conventional white light endoscopy. Biopsy showed a low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Chest and abdominal CT scan revealed no abnormal lesions. The endoscopic manifestations under WLE, ME-NBI, and iodine staining endoscopy, combining with pathology, led to the diagnosis of early esophageal cancer. Therefore, endoscopic therapy was chosen. The lesion was completely resected with endoscopic submucosal dissection. The lesion was histopathologically confirmed as early VCCE which was limited within the mucosal lamina propria (m2) and completely resected. There were no lymphovascular and neural invasions of cancer cells, and no cancer cells to be seen in the lateral and vertical margin of the resected specimen (the distance of the lesion to the closest margin of the resected specimen was 3.012mm).

Disposition: The patient is discharged in good condition.

Instructions: The patient is advised to follow up with their primary care physician.

History of Presenting Illness and Treatment:
The patient was treated with proton beam radiotherapy and developed a painful ulcer within the irradiation field a month after completing treatment. She received sustained-release oxycodone starting at 40 mg/day, which was gradually increased up to 160 mg/day (MED 240 mg/day) for pain control. The ulcer was relieved through skin grafting. The oxycodone dosage was gradually reduced, with mild restlessness occurring at 20 mg/day (12.5% of the maximum dosage); however, administration of the same dosage was continued as the symptom was mild and disappeared after a few days.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient reported experiencing cold sweats, malaise, and leg pain six hours after discontinuing oxycodone. Administration of sustained-release oxycodone (10 mg/day) once again was recommended, leading to the disappearance of symptoms. The patient continued receiving this medication for approximately five months due to fear of experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Final oxycodone discontinuation was achieved 323 days after the first onset of withdrawal symptoms.

Summary:
The patient was admitted due to treatment for vulvar sarcoma that was complicated by a painful ulcer. Pain control was achieved through sustained-release oxycodone, which saw a gradual decrease in dosage amount over the course of several months. Mild restlessness occurred at a dosage reduction of 20 mg/day, but the same dosage was administered continuously, and the symptom soon vanished.

Chief Complaint: Exertional dyspnea and bilateral lower extremity edema

Hospital Course:
The patient is a 35-year-old female who was admitted to the Emergency Department with a 3-month history of worsening exertional dyspnea and bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient also endorsed a nonproductive cough, pleuritic chest pain, occasional orthopnea, and an unintentional weight loss of 20 pounds over a one-month period. She was afebrile with mild tachycardia and respiratory distress. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with no acute injury pattern, and a chest radiograph showed a pleural-based wedge-like consolidation in the right inferior lobe consistent with Hampton's Hump. A limited echocardiogram revealed tricuspid valve vegetations and a slightly enlarged right ventricle without any D-sign. The patient subsequently underwent a CT-angiogram of the chest, which revealed multiple septic emboli and mycotic aneurysms and multiple segmental pulmonary arterial occlusions with associated infarcts or hemorrhage.

The patient was treated with IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover possible community-acquired pneumonia, and IV vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin to provide coverage for possible MRSA endocarditis. The patient was admitted with consultation of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Infectious Disease (ID). Blood cultures remained negative, and the causative pathogen was not identified.

The patient subsequently underwent a tricuspid valve annuloplasty and reconstruction using autologous pericardial tissue. The patient's blood cultures remained negative, and ID recommended the patient receive ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for 6 weeks. Pathology of the valve leaflets indicated granulation tissue with focal areas of bacterial colonization without bacterial identification. The remainder of the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, and on hospital day 15, she was transferred to a skilled nursing facility to complete her 6-week course of IV ceftriaxone.

Hospital Course	

The patient presented at the clinic with complaints of numbness in the soles of both feet. On lumbar MRI, severe L4-5 central stenosis and root redundancy were diagnosed. On February 28, 2018, L4-5 OLIF, followed by bilateral L4 laminotomy and L4-5 percutaneous posterior screw fixation (PPSF) was performed. 

Postoperatively, there was an increase in the disc height and foramen height. Two days later, the patient was allowed to walk while wearing an orthosis, and the radiating pain improved; he was then discharged from the hospital. At 6 weeks after surgery, lumbar CT and radiographic examination showed that the fusion was maintained without subsidence of the surgical site.

In the 10th week after surgery, the patient visited the outpatient clinic with a cane, complaining of persistent pain below both ankles and motor weakness of the right ankle. A decrease in dorsiflexion of the right ankle was observed. The Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength grade of the right ankle was 2. We confirmed the resolution of the previous central stenosis and root redundancy on lumbar MRI and found no other specific findings.

On May 21, 2018, the patient underwent right L4/5 facetectomy and foraminotomy to release the right L4 nerve root. During surgery, the tissues compressing the L4 nerve root and the osteophyte protruding severely and trapping the nerve root were identified and removed. Within 1 week of hospitalization after surgery, the radiating pain in both feet disappeared, and dorsiflexion of the right ankle was restored to MRC grade 4. After the second surgery, follow-up CT of the lumbar spine confirmed clear decompression of the right foramen.

Admitting Diagnosis: Bleeding from the prolapsed uterus

Clinical Synopsis:
An 80-year-old female was admitted with bleeding from the prolapsed uterus. The patient had a history of 3 vaginal births, the most recent one at the age of 30. Upon admission, a large portion of the vagina containing the cervix and part of the uterine body was found below the vaginal introitus (International Continence Society grade 3). Further examination revealed an exophytic infiltrating lesion covering the entire surface of the hypertrophic cervix spreading to the vaginal fornices.

Diagnostic Procedure:
The lesion in the cervix was sampled, and a rectoscopy was performed with sampling of the anal canal lesion for histopathology. The microscopic examination revealed, in the cervical specimen, moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma, featuring a strong and diffuse immunohistochemical p16 reaction in the neoplastic cells. In addition, the microscopic examination of the biopsy specimen from the anal canal lesion revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. MRI was also performed and revealed prolapsed cervix of irregular morphology, multiple low T2 signal round myometrial lesions suggestive of uterine fibroids, and an irregular mass-like thickening of the distal part of the rectum and anal canal.

Treatment:
The patient underwent a radical vaginal hysterectomy with extensive colpectomy preceded by laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, followed by radiotherapy. The patient did not consent to the anal extirpation due to personal reasons.

Discharge Condition:

Patient: 79-year-old Caucasian male with a 7-year history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

Hospitalization Dates: [insert dates]

Medical History: Positive for MDS and cholecystectomy. Daily medications included thalidomide, deferasirox, dimethicone, pantoprazole, gabapentin, vitamin B12, and folic acid. The patient also took erythropoietin and rivaroxaban three times a week and filgrastim every fifth day.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted with complaints of abdominal pain, fever, oral intolerance, nausea, and vomiting. On admission, he was ill and dehydrated with tenderness of the epigastrium and right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Laboratory results showed abnormalities, and abdominopelvic ultrasonography revealed mild fluid in subhepatic and inflamed echogenic fat in the upper abdomen and around the pancreas. A CT scan demonstrated edematous wall thickening of the entire duodenum with water halo and significant adjacent fat stranding and swelling of the pancreas, implying the possibility of ischemia or necrosis.

The patient was managed with intravenous antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. However, his condition deteriorated, leading to severe electrolyte imbalance, gasping, severe acidosis (arterial pH = 6.8), and GCS 4/15. The second CT scan revealed a marked decrease in the enhancement of the edematous duodenum and target sign, suggesting microvascular ischemia or necrosis.

The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room, where a midline laparotomy incision was made. Kocher’s maneuver was performed to explore the duodenum and the retroperitoneal structures. A Whipple’s procedure was planned initially, but the patient's cardiac arrest during the operation directed the plan to a damage control surgery. The overall operation time was approximately one hour and a half. To achieve a damage control surgery, decompression of the stomach was done by a red (18 French) nasogastric tube. Lastly, an open (corrugated sheet) drain was placed near the duodenum.

Despite two hours of supportive therapy, blood pressure remained 40 mmHg/pulse, leading to a cardiac arrest with asystole rhythm and patient expiration.

Impressions:

From the available data, the patient had a severe case of duodenal ischemia or necrosis after admission with abdominal pain, fever, oral intolerance, nausea, and vomiting. The possible etiologies may have been microvascular ischemia or necrosis.

Patient: 44-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted for induction chemotherapy (IC) on day 0 and experienced bone marrow suppression with fever and septic shock on day 10. Broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis were used empirically, with little success in controlling the patient's recurrent fever. The patient then experienced hemiplegia and hemiconvulsions on the right limb and was diagnosed with cerebral infarction in the right parietal lobe and small hypodense areas in the left and right parietal lobes. CT scans also showed multiple hyperdense lesions in the patient's lung on day 18. After a positive result for the test of (1,3)- β-D-glucan on day 22, treatment was changed to voriconazole (VRC) and imipenem, but the patient's fever persisted and the lesions in the brain and lung worsened.

On day 25, Rhizomucor miehei infection was shown by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of peripheral blood (PB) with high relative abundance, and liposome-associated amphotericin B was administered as antifungal therapy. The patient's fever subsided, and his complete blood count (CBC) returned to normal on day 28. Infection with Rhizomucor miehei was also detected by mNGS findings in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on day 28 and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 35. Antifungal therapy using liposome-associated amphotericin B was continued until day 55, and the patient's general condition improved, with partial recovery of the right limb function.

PATIENT NAME: [REDACTED]
AGE: 15 years

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient [name redacted] was admitted to our hospital with a 2-month history of fever, decreased appetite, and nonproductive cough. Despite being prescribed antibiotics for presumed community-acquired pneumonia a few weeks prior to admission, his cough and fever continued to worsen. 

Upon admission, he presented with fever, tachycardia, respiratory distress, and splenomegaly. Further laboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia, and a sputum gram stain showed gram-positive cocci. HBsAg and Anti-HCV and Anti-HIV were negative, and ANA, Anti ds-DNA, p-ANCA, and c-ANCA were requested but all showed negative results. Chest X-ray and CT-scan of the thorax showed bilateral and peripheral nodular and alveolar patterns, predominantly in the lower lobes of the lung, with no mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion observed. Abdominal sonography and CT showed observed hepatosplenomegaly, with splenomegaly being more pronounced than hepatomegaly. Para-aortic lymphadenopathy was not observed.

Two days after admission, the patient was observed to have a few small brown nodular lesions on the left leg, which necessitated the removal of a skin excisional biopsy. Meanwhile, his condition continued to worsen, with the onset of right hemiplegia, seizure, and aphasia one day later. A brain CT scan revealed a broadly hypo dense area on the left temporal and basal ganglia with little enhancement post-injection of IV contrast. The resulting skin biopsy showed severe infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes, with atypical lymphocytes observed on the subcutaneous and deep parts of the dermis. The primary aggregation of the cells was found around the vessels and nerves and appendices of the skin. The endothelial layer of the vessels showed signs of inflammation with no pattern of vasculitis observed.

The final diagnosis was lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG), and the patient was treated with steroid pulse therapy and oral cyclophosphamide. However, he did not display any clinical improvement and eventually expired after 12 days of treatment.

Hospital Course:
The patient's laboratory and radiologic evaluations showed no abnormalities, aside from iron-related parameters, serum iron, 110 ng/ml, ferritin, 3170 mg/dl (versus 29 mg/dL before transplant), transferrin, 119 mg/dL, and transferrin saturation, 66%. Repeated liver biopsy revealed sinusoidal fibrosis with mild cholangiolar proliferation. Iron staining showed significant accumulation of iron in macrophages and hepatocytes, consistent with marked hemosiderosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed or iron assessment revealed mild hepatic iron overload consistent with 5 mg/gr and did not show accumulation of iron in other organs: pancreas, adrenals, spleen, and heart. 

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with HH elicited by genetic defect in the donor tissue.

Treatment:
The patient was enrolled in a phlebotomy program.

Condition at Discharge:
The patient's condition improved and stable at the time of discharge.

Follow-up:
The patient's follow-up care should include ongoing phlebotomy to manage HH. Further genetic testing for HH is not indicated, as the patient's DNA has been previously tested and shown to not possess common HFE mutations (C282Y or H63D).","How can the term ""hereditary hemochromatosis elicited by genetic defect in the donor tissue"" be rephrased in plain language for better patient understanding?","In simpler terms, it means that you have inherited a condition called hereditary hemochromatosis, which causes your body to accumulate too much iron. We found out that the donor liver tissue you received has a genetic defect that caused this condition.

Patient: 45-year-old Hispanic male
History: End-stage renal disease of unknown etiology, hypertension, and high cholesterol. Had undergone a living related kidney transplant with induction therapy consisting of basiliximab and solumedrol. Maintenance therapy was with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone.

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient presented to the renal transplant clinic complaining of edema that had appeared over the previous three days. He admitted to inadvertently taking less tacrolimus than prescribed for almost one month. On examination, he had periorbital edema and lower extremity edema. Laboratory data showed an increase in creatinine, proteinuria, and hematuria. A renal biopsy was ordered and conducted, revealing evidence of postinfectious glomerulonephritis and minimal residual subendothelial electron dense deposits. Anti-streptolysin O (ASO) was elevated, indicating Streptococcus might have caused the infection.

Treatment:

Prednisone was increased, and the tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil dosages were increased, due to acute kidney injury, proteinuria, and hematuria. Given that his AKI did not appear to be due to rejection, tacrolimus was decreased back to the basal dose of 3 mg twice a day and prednisone was tapered to 10 mg daily. Fluid management was achieved with furosemide. No antibiotics were prescribed. A month later, creatinine had decreased and returned to baseline. Proteinuria and hematuria had completely resolved after three months.

Outcome:

The patient's condition improved significantly, and he was discharged in stable condition. Follow-up care was arranged with a recommendation to continue therapy and undergo regular check-ups.","Can you provide a more straightforward explanation for the term ""postinfectious glomerulonephritis"" mentioned in the discharge summary to aid in patient understanding?","Postinfectious glomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease that can occur after an infection, usually from a group A streptococcal infection.

Patient:
2-year-old boy

Presenting Problem:
Progressive painful and difficult voiding with only few drops of urine after straining, fever, agitation, vomiting, urinary retention, and significant abdominal distension.

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent an office-based surgical circumcision which resulted in profound bleeding that was ultimately controlled by deep suturing. However, during the postoperative period, the patient started to experience painful and difficult voiding. After about a week, the patient was referred to a district hospital with fever, agitation, vomiting, urinary retention, and significant abdominal distension. Urgent abdominopelvic ultrasound revealed a large volume of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis with a small amount of urine in the bladder. Catheterization with a 6-Fr feeding tube failed because it did not pass beyond the subcoronal urethra. The patient underwent an emergency midline laparotomy which revealed a small intraperitoneal bladder rupture at the dome of the bladder. The diagnosis of intraperitoneal bladder rupture with urinary ascites was made, likely caused by near-total urethral obstruction. The rupture site was repaired in two layers, and a suprapubic cystostomy catheter was fixed.

Follow-up:
Two months later, at our center, antegrade voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed via the suprapubic catheter which showed terminal urethral obstruction. A decision was made to explore the area and repair the urethra. An end-to-end urethral anastomosis was performed, and the postoperative period was uneventful. The patient was discharged home with a suprapubic and urethral catheter. The urethral catheter was removed seven days following surgery, and the suprapubic catheter was removed four weeks after surgery following normal urethral voiding and normal ultrasound. A VCUG was performed six weeks after surgery that showed normal bladder and urethra with acceptable voiding per urethra. During a 2.5-year follow-up period, the patient was asymptomatic with normal renal function, ultrasound, and voiding pattern. He had a maximum flow rate of 15.3 ml/sec in uroflowmetry study.

Contributing Factors:
The underlying cause of the rupture was likely due to near-total urethral obstruction.

Outcome:
The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy and urethral anastomosis procedure with no complications. The patient has since been asymptomatic with normal renal function, ultrasound, and voiding pattern.","How would you paraphrase the medical term ""intraperitoneal bladder rupture with urinary ascites"" used in the discharge summary for a patient and their family to understand?","""Intraperitoneal bladder rupture with urinary ascites"" means that there was a tear in the wall of the bladder, causing urine to leak into the abdominal cavity.

Admission Diagnosis:
Widely disseminated sebaceous carcinoma including metastases to brain, visceral organs, lymph nodes, and bone.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient presented for removal of a rapidly growing nodule in the anterior abdominal wall. Two days later, he developed confusion, urinary incontinence, and progressive aphasia. Emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 4 enhancing gray-white matter junctional lesions, and the patient underwent craniotomy and resection of bilateral frontal lobe tumors. The tumor was diagnosed as sebaceous carcinoma after a histopathologic examination. 

The patient commenced off-label treatment with pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg, every 3 weeks) in December 2016 due to strong PD-L1 expression, a moderately high tumor mutational burden, and a significant rationale for the use of checkpoint inhibitors in several other tumor types. A follow-up PET/CT scan 3 months after the initiation of anti-PD1 therapy revealed remarkable improvement in lymph nodes, lung, and soft tissue. A restaging PET/CT obtained after 6 months of treatment showed further significant improvements in all previously noted lesions. 

After 10 months of therapy, the patient developed severe fatigue and orthostatic hypotension, requiring hospitalization. Laboratory testing showed him to have secondary adrenal insufficiency and received adrenal replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (10 mg/5 mg) during high dose steroid therapy. 

Recent restaging studies demonstrate growth of the mediastinal metastases and a reduction in the size of the hepatic and small bowel metastases, suggestive of pseudoprogression and a durable ongoing response to pembrolizumab.

Length of Stay: __________

History and Reason for Admission:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presented with sudden onset periumbilical pain that migrated to the right iliac fossa accompanied by intermittent fever, nausea, and loss of appetite. The examination by two senior surgeons revealed guarding and rebound tenderness at the right iliac fossa. Hematological tests showed polymorphonuclear leukocytosis with left shift. USG could not visualize appendix. An Alvarado score of 9/10 was calculated, leading to the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Laparotomy was performed, and intraoperatively, the appendix appeared normal.

Hospital Course:
During the laparotomy, a hemorrhagic lesion appeared little deeper in the mid abdomen when the medial edge of the incision was retracted superomedially. To further explore this lesion, the incision was extended transversely from the medial edge. The exploration revealed an ulcerated lesion measuring 7 × 5 cm arising from the antimesenteric border of the ileum 8 feet from ICJ with localized interloop hemoperitoneum and inflammatory exudates. Resection of ileal segment containing the lesion was performed followed by restoration of bowel continuity and peritoneal toileting. Subsequently, the lesion was reported to be an ulcerated malignant ileal GIST. On gross examination, the growth from the ileum had villous lining epithelium with focal ulceration. The submucosal region had a circumscribed nodule with proliferation of loosely cohesive spindle cells; some of which were arranged in vague storiform pattern and others in long fascicles. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 8th postoperative day. She was advised to review a week later at the outpatients but failed to report.

Diagnosis:

The symptoms had persisted for 2 years and had been aggravated during the previous 2 months. The patient was previously misdiagnosed with epilepsy in another hospital, but no abnormal findings were detected on a 24-h electroencephalogram at our hospital. Her abdominal perfusion CT showed a highly perfused nodule within the pancreatic tail, while a magnetic resonance scan confirmed the location of this nodule. Additionally, 68Ga-exendin 4 PET-CT showed a region in the pancreatic tail with abnormally high metabolism and overexpression of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor. Lab testing showed low fasting blood glucose, a high proinsulin level, a normal C-peptide level, a serum insulin level, and a gastrin level. These results confirmed a diagnosis of insulinoma. A minimally invasive insulinoma enucleation surgery under the Da Vinci robot-assisted system with intraoperative ultrasound was performed, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6. Pathological examination showed that the tumor was a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with a Ki-67 index of 4%.

Patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted with symptoms of persistent liver dysfunction, painless xanthochromia and skin itching for 3 months. Physical examination revealed severe icteric sclera and skin without any abdominal tenderness. 

Diagnostic Results: 

Liver function tests showed severe hepatic injury and obstructive jaundice. Ultrasound of the liver showed a cystic mass with sharp margins in the left medial liver lobe and obstruction of the biliary tract. CT and MRI confirmed the presence of a cystic mass with homogeneous water-density lesions, indicating a hepatic cyst. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a lump in the common bile duct but no stones were found. A subsequent open procedure confirmed a large pedunculated lump from the liver, which resembled the gallbladder with a capsule wall and capsular space. Histopathologic examination confirmed the lump was a hepatic cyst wall without heterocysts or tumor cells. 

Hospital Course: 

Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) were performed to drain bile in order to manage severe hepatic injury and jaundice, instead of laparotomy due to coagulation disorders. After these procedures, there was a gradual decrease in icteric sclera and skin, recovery of liver function, and normalization of coagulation disorders. Four weeks later, open operation was performed, and the pedunculated lump from the liver was removed entirely from the lump's root through endoscopic needle-knife electrotomy without active hemorrhage. 

Treatment: 

A T-tube was retained in the common bile duct to prevent bile leakage and observe the recovery of the root incision of the lump and postoperative bleeding. The patient was discharged with appropriate post-operative care instructions. 

Follow-up: 

Epigastric ultrasound and CT two months later showed a normal hepatic duct and unchanged hepatic cyst size. Choledochoscopic examination was performed through a T-tube fistula. The cyst had remained unchanged, and there was no evidence of bile duct tumor. Three years after the procedure, the patient was in good health, without signs of cholestasis or bile duct stones.

The patient, a 30-year-old Deaf, Hispanic male, was admitted to the hospital after his mother reported that he was behaving oddly and not taking his medication as prescribed. Upon initial psychiatric interview, an interpreter was not present, and the patient was communicating via written responses. He maintained bizarre delusions, but denied current suicidal ideation (SI), homicidal ideation (HI), or auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH).

The patient, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, had been taking risperidone for several years but was tired of continuing the medication due to side effects of drowsiness and weight gain. He reported that he was in an American Sign Language (ASL) school and learning a career in massage therapy. After meeting a girlfriend, he began to develop a sense of independence that he reported his mother disapproved of. This caused an altercation that precipitated his admission.

With the assistance of an ASL interpreter, the patient was answering questions logically with a linear thought process. He reported that he was feeling fine and not crazy, and that all of these events were happening because his mother does not understand Deaf culture. He also conveyed that he did not like to take his meds because they interfered with him being able to drink alcohol and caused drowsiness.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient, a 63-year-old woman, was transferred to our department from the internal medicine clinic of the hospital with a diagnosis of acute abdomen due to possible rupture of the bladder. She had a known medical history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver with extensive ascites. On admission to the internal medicine clinic, she was diagnosed with acute abdominal pain, urinary retention, and high white blood cell count and CRP levels. The patient was immediately started on empiric antibiotic treatment with good recovery until the third day when her condition worsened.
On the third day, the patient presented with rebound tenderness, involuntary guarding, and a completely rigid “washboard” abdomen with percussion tenderness. She was haemodynamically unstable. Blood pressure was low and heart rate was high. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen indicated the presence of gas within the bladder wall and extravasation of contrast solution in the peritoneal cavity. Emergency surgery was decided and a partial cystectomy with debridement of the necrotic tissue, preservation of both ureters, and peritoneal lavage were performed. A suprapubic catheter and two surgical drains were used.
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit in a critical condition and unfortunately, succumbed 12 hours later due to multiple organ dysfunction and septic shock. Histology revealed extensive necrosis of the entire bladder wall.

The 35-year-old male patient was admitted with a right distal tibial non-union, which had developed into varus deformity after sustaining a high-energy, multifragmentary compound fracture 4 months earlier. The patient was treated with a below-knee, weight-bearing Sarmiento cast which was later replaced by a retrograde expandable nail. The non-union was successfully treated, and the patient had uneventfully returned to work. However, 9 months later, there were signs of calcaneal resorption around the nail, which warranted its removal. The first attempt to remove the nail failed when it fractured at the junction between the valve and metal fins.

The patient was admitted with complaints of intermittent vaginal spotting for 1 month. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a 10-cm multi-lobular cystic pelvic mass containing the mixed heterogeneous solid component, fluid and papillary growth in the inner surface of cystic wall. The patient underwent optimal debulking surgery, including total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy, and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Histologically, sections of the left ovarian tumor showed a clear cell carcinoma. Right ovarian tumor showed metastatic clear cell carcinoma. Combination of all findings made a diagnosis of AFP-producing clear cell type EOC with fetal gut differentiation, FIGO IIIc. After surgery, the patient received adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel).
After treatment, CT showed a 2-cm hypodense nodule at the right subphrenic region and wedge-shaped hypoperfusion over segment 7 of the liver, suspicious tumor seeding, and liver metastasis. Tumor excision for liver metastasis was done. Dose-intensity chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel was given. CT scan, 1 year later, showed a lobulated mixed solid and cystic lesion at the right paracolic gutter measuring 5 cm in size in favor of peritoneal seeding. Exploratory laparotomy was done, including the use of Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator. After operation, chemotherapy was given through intraperitoneal route. After additional 18 months, tumor recurrence was found, including persistent liver metastases, with increasing serum level of AFP. The patient finally died of disease.

Hospital Course:
The patient, an 80-year-old female, was admitted to the clinic with a mass over the superior aspect of the right scapula. The mass, though achy, did not interfere with performing activities of daily living, but had been enlarging over the previous few months. The patient had no local injuries or recent surgeries on the affected side, and denied having weakness in the left arm or trouble with overhead activities. A similar mass on the contralateral side was excised 10 years previously with favorable results. Inspection of the area was unremarkable, but palpation revealed a firm, nonmobile, and nonpulsatile mass, which was slightly tender upon deeper pressure. Shoulder examination showed no signs of rotator cuff weakness or shoulder pain. X-ray revealed narrowing of the posterior glenohumeral joint space, which was consistent with osteoarthritic changes. MRI revealed an elongated cystic lesion arising from the AC joint and tracking medially to superficial and within the trapezius muscle. The lesion measured 2 cm (AP) × 13 cm (transverse) × 1.8 cm (craniocaudad), and had peripheral enhancement. There was also suspected full-thickness tear of the anterior fibers of the supraspinatus.

Treatment:
The patient underwent excision of the mass via a general anesthetic. Careful dissection revealed a stalk emanating from the AC joint, which was identified and dissected free. The mass was removed en bloc, and a distal clavicle excision was performed using an oscillating saw. After the cyst was excised, it was incised revealing thick mucoid content. Postsurgery, the patient reported immediate pain relief and continued to have full and pain-free range of motion with no signs of recurrence during follow-up visits at three weeks and three months.

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a past medical history significant for alcoholism, tobacco abuse, noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis. He presented with an enlarging right-neck mass in November of 2015, which was found to be a malignant squamous cell carcinoma on fine-needle aspiration. No further treatment was pursued at that time due to socioeconomic issues. However, the patient experienced three flares of painful neck adenopathy over the next sixteen months, each of which was treated with short courses of antibiotics and steroids.

The patient returned in March of 2017 when his latest flare of right-sided neck adenopathy failed to respond to the usual treatment. A CT scan revealed multiple low-density cystic structures in the right neck consistent with necrotic lymph nodes. A PET-CT scan showed right neck hypermetabolic uptake, and a CT scan of the chest showed no obvious disease and no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Further testing revealed an ALK+ LBCL diagnosis based on H&E- stained mass excisional biopsy material. Additionally, NGS testing confirmed the absence of any significant genetic mutations associated with myeloid malignancies. The patient was subsequently admitted for further workup and management.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency room with a right shoulder mass in September 2014, which was causing acute pain, weakness and paresthesias in the right arm. He was admitted to the general medicine service for pain management and underwent an evaluation for his right shoulder mass. Physiatry was consulted due to his functional deterioration that precluded him from returning to his previous independent living arrangement. The MRI revealed a 6.9 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass involving the right deltoid and pectoralis major muscles, and the core biopsy showed a high grade spindle cell sarcoma.

Treatment Approach:
The oncology department recommended neo-adjuvant radiation therapy followed by gross total resection with wide margins. Physiatry conducted a pre-operative evaluation to focus on functional prognostication. The patient's personal values combined with physiatric assessment determined the pre-surgical planning. A decision was made to take a narrower surgical margin around key muscle group (pectoralis major and deltoids) in order to help maintain the man's manual wheelchair mobility and his ability to independently transfer himself. In November 2014, he completed neo-adjuvant radiation therapy and underwent radical excision of his right shoulder mass with flap closure in December 2014.

Rehabilitation:
The patient began intensive inpatient rehabilitation after he was allowed to weight bear through his arm about 8 weeks later. Initially he required total assistance for most Activities of Daily Living (ADL), including transfers, manual wheelchair propulsion, dressing and toileting. Despite the extensive surgery and radiation treatments, the gentleman was able to return to a functional level, approaching his pre-morbid status (modified independence).

During the segmented VMAT beam delivery, the implant marker stayed at the planned breath-hold position, and a DRR image at the gantry start angle was created for each segment. Breath-hold training was given to the patient for optimizing the breath-hold and the following free-breathing periods to successfully complete each segmented breath-hold VMAT delivery.

Subsequently, two lateral lines were manually copied onto a fluoroscopic image window of the XVI display using a transparent sheet. Each line was used as a tolerance limit for the breath-hold beam delivery. During the beam delivery, the breath-hold status was continuously monitored to ensure that the marker position stayed within the tolerance range. If the marker moved outside the tolerance range, beam delivery was interrupted, and the procedure was repeated.

Breath-hold CBCT imaging was performed to confirm that the marker position relative to the tumor remained unchanged. The total VMAT delivery time for a prescribed fraction dose of 3Gy was approximately 115sec, with three beam interrupts and a 25 sec segmented beam delivery followed by 20 sec free breathing.

The patient, a 78-year-old male from a rural area in western Iran, was admitted to the Razi Hospital Dermatology Clinic, Tehran, with multiple ulcerative and exudative lesions on mid-face, dorsal aspect of hands, and posterior aspect of heels. Lesions had been present for three years and had progressively enlarged above the upper lip, anterior portion of the nasal fossa, above the eyebrows and heels, and become ulcerative. 

History and Physical Examination:

The patient's past medical history was unremarkable, with no comorbid conditions, drug use, systemic symptoms, weight loss, fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or any signs of systemic involvement in physical examination and laboratory survey.

Diagnostic Assessment:

Multiple treatments were attempted for potential differential diagnosis, including pyoderma gangrenosum, sarcoidosis, and leishmaniasis, but with no improvement in the lesions. Skin biopsy revealed necrotizing and palisading granulomatous tissue pattern that suggested infectious etiology. The smear of lesions for fungal and mycobacteria and Leishmania was negative. PPD test with 27 mm induration was positive, and anti-tuberculosis treatment including isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was started.

A month after initiating drugs for tuberculosis, the smear of leishmaniasis repeated that was positive this time, the second biopsy revealed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and infiltration of the dermis by mixed inflammatory cells and Leishman bodies compatible with leishmaniasis, and RFLP PCR was carried out on DNA extraction that confirmed L. major as the pathogenic agent.

Hospital Course:

Upon confirmation of L. major as the pathogenic agent, treatment initiated with 3 gr per day of meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime®) until 1 wk followed by 4.5 gr per day for another week. Despite a good response to meglumine antimoniate after 2 wk of treatment, we were forced to discontinue the drug due to cardiac toxicity.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient is a 58-year-old non-smoking female with a history of recurrent papillary thyroid cancer, breast cancer, and liver metastases of unclear origin. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit due to persistent seizures requiring intubation for airway protection. Brain MRI revealed multifocal white matter edema affecting the occipital and parietal lobes with patchy gadolinium enhancement, predominantly affecting the posterior distribution, but also with frontal lobe lesions with associated vasogenic edema and patchy enhancement. A small acute infarct in the left centrum semiovale on diffusion-weighted imaging was also noted. She developed a fever early in her hospitalization, and extensive workup for infectious causes revealed right lower lobe pneumonia treated with vancomycin and cefepime. Her cerebrospinal fluid studies were not consistent with signs of meningitis or systemic vasculitis.

Based on her clinical findings, a presumed diagnosis of PRES was made, and the patient was treated accordingly. She also developed stress cardiomyopathy with tachycardia, and was started on captopril and metoprolol. However, ultimately, a decision was made for the patient to stop using lenvatinib and continue with lacosamide for epilepsy management. Despite her improved clinical condition, the patient's cancer progression resulted in non-resolving lactic acidosis without systemic signs of poor organ perfusion. The patient was advised to follow up with oncology and neurology for continuation of care.

Due to old injuries and unsuccessful surgeries, the mandibular deficiency had developed, and lateral and forward motions of the mandible were restricted.

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent a two-step treatment plan, starting with the gap arthroplasty method, followed by DO. After the gap arthroplasty surgery, physiotherapy was started, which was followed by a soft diet to aid in jaw-opening exercises. A normal diet was started after three to four weeks, and the patient was evaluated once a week to track changes.

Four months later, the osteodistractor was installed with a custom-made device called the Sh-device to prevent upward and backward shifts of the proximal mandibular segment. Recommended displacement rate of the Sh-device was 0.5mm per day, which was carried out for a month. The mandible moved about 15 to 20mm forward, and the patient's breathing and sleeping improved.

At the 8-year follow-up, the patient's profile was satisfactory, and the maximum incisal opening had increased to 38mm.

Admission Diagnosis: Primary antiphospholipid syndrome with end-stage renal failure

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with end-stage renal failure secondary to primary antiphospholipid syndrome. He underwent a tissue-matched renal allograft transplant, with optimized anticoagulation prior to surgery. During the early postoperative period, he developed a peri-renal hematoma which was managed by withholding anticoagulation and he recovered well. He was discharged with his urethral catheter and ureteric stent removed and warfarin restarted.

Three weeks after the surgery, he presented with reduced urine output and progressive abdominal distension. An ultrasound scan showed a large perigraft collection, and during surgical exploration, a completely sloughed off allograft ureter was found with an intact allograft renal pelvis. An allograft pelvis-native ureter ureteropyelostomy was performed with a stable postoperative recovery.

At 6 months following reconstructive surgery, the patient developed a perirenal abscess around the graft kidney which was successfully drained. A 99 m-Technetium DTPA renography was performed 9 months after surgery with normal uptake and excretion and no evidence of obstruction. At 1 year following the reconstructive surgery, the patient had good urine output with a stable serum creatinine.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with recurrent, unexplained syncope. The baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and telemetry monitoring showed atrial fibrillation and conduction abnormalities. Electrophysiology (EP) study with possible device implantation was recommended due to concern over paroxysmal AV block or ventricular arrhythmia as the cause of his syncope.

An octapolar catheter was positioned near the His-bundle location during the EP study. Intracardiac electrograms revealed infra-Hisian block at baseline, and there were no inducible ventricular arrhythmias during the EP study. Pacing from the His catheter in this location resulted in QRS narrowing, and it was decided to implant a permanent His-bundle pacemaker. The PHB lead was directed toward the membranous septum using a fixed-curve delivery sheath.

High-output unipolar pacing from the PHB lead resulted in a narrow QRS complex with resolution of the conduction abnormalities. However, intracardiac EGMs on the octapolar catheter revealed that the recorded His-bundle potential was not captured during PHB lead pacing. The octapolar catheter was advanced beyond the PHB lead tip to ensure there was not capture of the distal His bundle. Pacing at lower outputs resulted in non-selective His capture.

The patient remained stable throughout the hospital course. The thresholds for His-bundle capture and RV septal capture remained stable, and the patient was discharged the next morning.

Principal Diagnosis: MDS with excess blasts: refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1)

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 75-year-old Caucasian man, was admitted for bicytopenia in May 2013. His initial blood cell count showed hemoglobin 8 g/dl, platelets 87 × 109/l, and leukocytes 6.1 × 109/L. He had a medical history of T2D treated with biphasic insulin aspart and triple-bypass surgery for coronary disease in 2010. No family history of hematological malignancies was noted. He was hospitalized in an intensive care unit for grade IV anemia and then transferred to the hematology department after blood transfusions. Bone marrow aspiration showed multilineage dysplasia with 8% of blasts, consistent with a diagnosis of MDS with excess blasts: refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1).

The patient was initially treated with darbepoetin 300 μg per week, without response. A second bone marrow aspiration two months later showed 29% of blasts, consistent with the diagnosis of AML progression. He consented to participate in a phase I–II clinical research study assessing the combination of 5-azacitidine with idarubicin in July 2013. He showed a partial response with 8% of bone marrow blasts after six cycles, and transfusion independence.

However, the patient reported higher blood glucose levels 2–3 days after the start of each 5-azacitidine cycle, requiring an increased dose of self-administered insulin. Further monitoring confirmed higher blood glucose levels from days 4 to 12 of each 5-azacitidine cycle. No change in diet or in physical activities was noted. Our patient experienced such dysregulation during all the additional 15 cycles until a fatal progression of AML.

Impression:

The patient was admitted with bicytopenia and diagnosed with MDS with excess blasts: refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1). After no response to initial treatment, he participated in a clinical research study and experienced a partial response. However, he had blood glucose dysregulation during the treatment cycles.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 35-year-old nulliparous African-American female presented with a history of five first and one second trimester recurrent pregnancy losses. In addition, she had a nine-year history of irregular heavy bleeding associated with dysmenorrhea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient's past medical history was not significant.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was scheduled for hysteroscopy and diagnostic laparoscopy. She also gave consent for possible open Strassmans metroplasty.

On hysteroscopy, a normal looking endometrium was visualized with a right-sided tubal ostia and a small tubal ostia on the left that did not appear to be patent. Laparoscopically, a bicornuate uterus was found with associated endometriosis at the vesicouterine fold. Open metroplasty was done. A copper intrauterine device was left in situ to separate the uterine walls and possibly reduce the chances of uterine synechiae. In addition, endometriotic deposits discovered at the vesico uterine fold were ablated.

The patient had an unremarkable follow-up after surgery with no complications reported. A HSG 6 months after surgery revealed unification of the uterine horns but both tubes were not delineated.

Patient was lost to follow-up but two years later she presented having conceived spontaneously and a TVS revealed a single intrauterine pregnancy at 13 weeks. Her antenatal workup was as highlighted in the medical record.

At 33 weeks, the patient presented with a history of lower abdominal pain worsening over the past few weeks and right-sided fundal tenderness pain score of seven out of ten on the pain assessment scale. The patient did not have any features suggestive of bowel obstruction and had a normal NST and an obstetric ultrasound that was done showed a single intrauterine pregnancy with normal biophysical profile and no features of placental abruption or slower uterine segment site dehiscence. The pain was significant enough to warrant an admission for which she subsequently received antenatal steroids for lung maturity and opioid analgesia for pain relief. However, the pain did not completely resolve and she underwent a cesarean delivery at 33 weeks and 5 days due to persistent lower abdominal pain. The outcome was a live male infant with a birth weight of 1950 grams and APGAR of 9, 10, 10. There was no evidence of uterine rupture although she had venous congestion and massive varicose veins bilaterally at the cornual areas. The previous metroplasty scar was intact.

The patient had a resolution of the abdominal pain postoperatively and had an unremarkable postoperative recovery. She was discharged on the fifth postoperative day.

Hospital Course:

Admitted inpatient for surgical management of a right nipple lesion. The patient reports noticing a small yellow bump on her nipple two years prior and becoming concerned due to rapid growth in the last year. A shave biopsy four months prior suggested squamous cell carcinoma. On examination, the patient had a 2.2 cm lesion occupying the right nipple with erythematous and rigid breast along with yellow pus draining from the nipple. An MRI was ordered and revealed no underlying breast malignancy.

A wedge biopsy of the nipple was performed to confirm the initial shave biopsy pathology. Histopathology showed verrucous features with chronic inflammation and underlying abscess with some possibility of cutaneous malignancy and HPV L1 Capsid protein. Due to inadequate sample removal in the initial shave biopsy and positive margins, excision with wide margins was determined to be appropriate for removal of the lesion.

The patient underwent a wide excision of the right nipple-areola complex for removal of the growth without any complications. Following the surgery, the final histologic examination revealed a large tumor with verrucous and hyperkeratotic features, dyskeratosis, nests of keratin pearl formation along with microinvasion of the dermis and loss of basal lamina. However, no tumor cells were found in all margins.

The post-op course was uneventful. During the hospital stay, the patient was treated for an abscess with antibiotic therapy, and the patient's status improved. She was monitored for potential recurrence of the growth during the follow-up period.

Summary of Events:
The patient was a healthy 40-year-old man who presented at the emergency room after a high energetic accident that resulted in multiple fractures and comprehensive soft tissue defects on his left lower leg and foot. A thorough clinical examination, along with diagnostic imaging, revealed numerous fractures, including a Gustilo grade IIIB fracture, a medial malleolus fracture, a Tillaux-Chaput fracture, fractures of the navicular bone, cuboid, and five metatarsal heads, and base fractures of the first and second proximal phalanx.

Within the first thirteen hours after admission, the patient underwent placement of an external fixator and debridement of the proximal medial wound. Subsequently, he underwent two more debridements and was treated with EpigardTM and absorbent dressings.

Within the first 24 hours postoperatively, NIRF imaging was performed, which displayed the area of vital and non-viable tissue. The patient underwent a final debridement approximately 6 days after hospital admission in the same session as definitive soft tissue coverage. Intraoperative imaging showed no difference in the extension of the fluorescent area compared to the previous NIRF imaging.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's active extension and flexion of the toes were preserved, as well as sensibility in the toes and forefoot. Disturbed sensibility to touch and pain was identified at the foot sole. No signs of a compartment syndrome were found.

Treatment and Management:
The patient was treated with debridement, external fixation, and temporary wound coverage with EpigardTM and absorbent dressings. Intraoperative NIRF image-guidance was used to identify non-viable skin that needed to be removed. The patient then underwent a free anterolateral thigh flap to cover the defect on the medial malleolus and foot sole, with additional split skin graft placed to cover the superficial defect at the lateral malleolus.

The patient had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia for 5 years and underwent radiation therapy of the total body and bone marrow transplantation at age 6. Since the onset of the disease, the patient had been receiving steroids. Three months post-transplantation, the patient developed lung disease secondary to graft- versus-host disease and received high doses of steroids. Subsequently, the patient developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia and was treated again with high doses of steroids. Physical examination revealed a small Cushingoid boy with severe loss of muscle bulk due to steroid-induced myopathy.

Radiographic evaluation of the spine and hips revealed compression fractures in the thoracic spine (T11, T12) and mild deformity of the femoral epiphyses. BMD was measured in the lumbar spine (L1-4) and proximal femur using DXA. Trabecular BMD was measured at the 4% distal radius using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). On the basis of established pediatric densitometric criteria, a diagnosis of low bone mineral content was made and patient was started on treatment with vitamin D and calcium.

Follow-up DXA studies to determine response to treatment at 12 months demonstrated collapse of the femoral head and an increase in BMD. Sequential follow-up DXA scans at 24 months showed further destruction of the femoral head and an increase in bone mass. Trabecular BMD at the 4% distal radial site by pQCT at 12 and 24 months showed a decrease. The concurrent visual assessment of the DXA images showed progressive deterioration of the left hip joint, beginning as vague osteosclerosis and becoming severe with destruction of the femoral head, suggesting the diagnosis of osteonecrosis.

The patient, a 48-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, presented to the gastroenterology department in November 2006 complaining of severe epigastric pain and nausea for two days. The laboratory findings were suspicious for pancreatitis and the patient underwent computed tomography (CT), which showed an edematous pancreas tail and fluid in the anterior prerenal space and fascia. He had two similar episodes of acute tail pancreatitis in the following months. 

In September 2009, the patient presented with vague epigastric pain of several weeks duration. Serum amylase and lipase levels were normal, but the cholestatic parameters were mildly elevated. A magnetic resonance (MR) study was performed, which demonstrated moderate chronic pancreatitis of the tail with atrophy and irregular bordering of the Wirsung’s duct. Helicobacter pylori gastritis was also diagnosed. 

In February 2012, the patient presented again to the gastroenterologist with epigastric and left upper quadrant pain. Contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed to evaluate the known chronic pancreatitis and other causes of pain. The study surprisingly revealed a hypervascular lesion in the pancreatic tail consisting of a conglomeration of small hypervascular spots and blood vessels. Further examinations were performed in order to differentiate a vascular malformation from a hypervascular pancreatic tumor, especially an islet cell tumor or a hypervascular metastasis. Contrast-enhanced MR study showed a focal area of heterogeneous contrast enhancement without an apparent nodular component. The subsequent angiography showed two large feeding arteries in the early arterial phase, followed by a racemose vascular network, an early transient dense parenchyma stain in the early portal phase and early wash-out of the lesion in the portal phase. Based on these findings, a pancreatic arteriovenous malformation was suggested. 

The patient underwent resection of the pancreas tail and postoperative recovery was uneventful. Histopathologic examination revealed sequelae of chronic pancreatitis and numerous dilated blood vessels accompanied by blood clot formation and intimal hyperplasia. The histopathological findings were consistent with a pancreatic AVM.

Admission Diagnosis:
The patient presented to the emergency department with pain localized to the right costovertebral angle and associated shoulder pain.

Hospital Course:
Laboratory findings showed raised inflammatory parameters (CRP 116 mg/dL). Non-contrast-enhanced CT-scan was performed which revealed a high-density structure in the liver segment 7 surrounded by a hypodense zone of 25 mm, containing small air bubbles suggestive of an intrahepatic abscess. Review of the contrast enhanced CT-scan performed two weeks earlier on the occasion of an acute appendicitis learned that this intrahepatic calcification had the same characteristics as the appendicolith on the previous scan. Based on the patient's medical history and diagnostic tests, the patient had a dropped appendicolith, which had spontaneously migrated into the liver parenchyma causing an intrahepatic abscess. 

Treatment:
During the second laparoscopic exploration, the appendicolith was extracted and the abscess was drained. Microbiology was positive for Escherichia coli. Intravenous antibiotics were administered for four days.

Reason for admission: Nuchal pain at C3-C4 level radiating to the left arm. 

Medical history: No previous history of cardiac, respiratory, hepatic, or renal diseases. No history of allergies. 

Physical examination: CT scan of the cervical spine revealed a right-sided accessory articulation between the anterior transverse processes of C6 and C7. The transverse foramina of C6 and C7 showed a partial defect, respectively posterior and anterior. No disc herniation was found on the CT scan, both the upper and lower cervical spine was free of any pathological changes.

Hospital course: The patient was referred to the hospital for exclusion of disc herniation. A CT scan revealed an incidental finding, a right-sided accessory articulation. The patient did not receive any medical intervention, and treatment was limited to pain management and observation. The patient reported a reduction in nuchal pain, and the left arm's radicular symptoms disappeared.

Diagnosis: Incidental finding of right-sided accessory articulation between the anterior transverse processes of C6 and C7.

The patient was admitted for management of presumed pelvic infection, following a total vaginal hysterectomy with adnexal conservation. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 6.2 x 9.7 cm pelvic abscess adjacent to the vaginal cuff, which was drained by interventional radiology. She was started on IV piperacillin/tazobactam and was transitioned to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium after four days of intravenous antibiotics. She was discharged home on hospital day 5 with a two-week course of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, pending the results of vaginal wound cultures.

Follow-Up:
The patient returned for her outpatient visit approximately one week later. The results of the vaginal wound cultures revealed a large growth of Actinomyces meyeri. An Infectious Disease (ID) specialist recommended an additional two-week course of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. The patient then returned to the ED on postoperative day 25 and 27 with worsening shortness of breath and chest pain, respectively. A repeat chest X-ray showed slight progression of right basilar heterogeneous opacities thought to be infectious. An intravenous antibiotic regimen was preferred, and the patient completed an outpatient two-week course of IV ampicillin/sulbactam as recommended. On postoperative day 37, a repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed near complete resolution of the previous pelvic abscess.

Age: 49 years old
Gender: Female
Admission Date: [Date]
Discharge Date: [Date]
Diagnosis: Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS)

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 49-year-old previously healthy female, was admitted with a 1-week history of posterior-region knee pain that occurred after falling directly onto her left knee from a standing position. Following the fall, she experienced blocked knee joint and limited range of motion of 30 to 60 degrees of flexion. On examination, the patient had good lower-limb alignment and no pain was provoked on meniscal and ligament testing. She also had an absence of muscular atrophy.

Upon examination, the patient's range of motion was limited to only 30 to 60 degrees of flexion with pain on active range of motion. She had pain upon active and passive extension of the knee joint with tingling and numbness over the calf region extending from the knee posteriorly. MRI revealed a multiloculated structure arising from the synovium around the cruciate ligaments within the femoral notch extending beyond the joint capsule posteriorly with moderate anterior joint effusion.

The patient underwent arthroscopic intervention in the left knee under spinal anesthesia. The posterior compartment of the knee was reached arthroscopically through the triangular space formed by the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) laterally, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) medially, and the femoral notch superiorly. Total resection of the lesion was done through only anterior knee portals without taking the risk of posterior portals preventing potential neurovascular injury. The pathology report confirmed the presence of PVNS.

On 6-month MRI follow-up, the previously described soft tissue enhancement suggestive of residual inflammatory changes noted within the femoral notch along the cruciate ligaments as well as posterior to the distal metaphysis at the site of the previously present lesion has decreased. The synovial fluid had also decreased with no evidence of hemosiderin deposits. There was no evidence of interval appearance of new susceptibility artifacts or blooming effect on the T2 gradient sequence that could correspond to evident recurrence. The compressive effect previously present on the popliteal vessels has completely disappeared with no further tingling sensation and numbness over the calf region. Clinically, the patient regained full range of motion on flexion extension (0° to 135°) of the knee. The previously reported pain no longer exists, with no blocking upon flexion. The patient underwent physical therapy protocol and showed significant muscle strength and balancing improvement. She was scheduled to 1-year clinical follow-up.

Discharge Condition:
The patient's discharge condition is stable and satisfactory. The patient is to follow-up on 1-year clinical check-ups for further evaluation.

Admitting Diagnosis: Forwardly placed upper front teeth

Hospital Course:

An 11-year-old male child presented to the department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics with a chief complaint of forwardly placed upper front teeth. The clinical examination revealed a convex facial profile due to mandibular retrusion and a mesoprosopic facial pattern. The intraoral examination revealed excessive overbite with incomplete, 8 mm interlabial gap and class II canine relation. The cephalometric analysis confirmed a marked class II dental relationship with mandibular retrusion, average growth pattern, normal axial inclination of upper incisors, proclined lower incisors, acute nasolabial angle, and mild rotation of the second premolars. The treatment objective was positive and suggested fixed appliance treatment to correct overjet with functional appliance and growth modulation deemed ineffective.

Treatment Summary:

The patient was treated with a fixed twin block appliance to correct the overjet and with the placement of fixed appliances to align the arches. The treatment plan involved two steps, with the correction of skeletal malocclusion as the primary objective and the correction of dental malocclusion as the secondary objective.

Patient Name: [redacted]

Age: 66-year-old

Gender: Female

Race: African-American

Initial Diagnosis: Cocaine-induced bilateral posterior inferior cerebellar artery and hippocampal infarction with multifocal punctate infarcts in bilateral posterior cerebral artery and basal ganglia secondary to severe vasoconstriction. Mild encephalopathy also observed.

Medical History: Polysubstance abuse (heroin, prescription opioids), bacterial endocarditis 30 years ago with remote epidural abscess, cervical cord compression from C3-C6 and myelopathy with residual bilateral upper extremity contractures and lower extremity weakness, hepatitis C, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Clinic Course: The patient was brought to ER due to confusion and short-term memory loss with significant receptive aphasia. She had no pain, fever, chest pain, palpitations, loss of consciousness, or seizure-like activity. She was a middle-aged lady who was alert oriented to name and place but not to time. Physical examination showed decreased bulk in bilateral upper extremities with moderate spasticity, tight contractures of the arms and forearms in flexed posture with some antigravity strength. Both posterior inferior cerebellar arteries were widely patent, and there was no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus. CT of the brain showed heterogeneous low attenuation involving the entirety of bilateral cerebellar hemispheres with areas of petechial hemorrhage along with encephalomalacia in the right insular and anterior operculum. An MRI of the brain along with MR venogram showed infarcts in the bilateral occipital lobes, both hippocampi, and bilateral basal ganglia suspicious for an embolic phenomenon. Cerebral angiography was deferred given normal CT angiography. Blood cultures drawn on the day of admission showed no growth, and telemetric monitoring was unremarkable during the course of hospitalization. The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility after seven days with persisting memory problems and unable to recognize faces. 

Medications upon discharge: Unknown

Follow-up Care: Lost to follow-up.

Other Information: The patient had a past medical history of polysubstance abuse, including heroin and prescription opioids, which may have been responsible for the current condition. The clinical course showed significant receptive aphasia and decreased extremity strength, which were evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke scale assessment. Despite suspicion for posterior circulation large vessel occlusion, CT angiogram of the head and neck ruled out any dissection, significant stenosis, or occlusion of intracranial or extracranial cerebral vasculature. The differential diagnosis included multifocal infarction secondary to cocaine-related vasospasm and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and infective endocarditis with septic emboli. However, negative blood cultures, normal echocardiogram, and lack of fever and other constitutional symptoms ruled out the last possibility. The patient was diagnosed with cocaine-induced bilateral posterior inferior cerebellar artery and hippocampal infarction with multifocal punctate infarcts in the bilateral posterior cerebral artery and basal ganglia secondary to severe vasoconstriction.

FINAL DISCHARGE SUMMARY

Admission Date: [REDACTED] Discharge Date: [REDACTED]

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 45-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue. Previously, the patient had received the standard of care chemotherapy treatment, which was not effective. She was enrolled in a Phase I clinical trial of combination therapy with daily cediranib and once every 2 weeks of durvalumab.

During the hospitalization, the patient developed sinus tachycardia and was found to have hazy bibasilar interstitial markings on a portable chest x-ray. Further evaluation revealed a dilated right ventricle with decreased function and an elevated right ventricular systolic pressure of 67 mmHg. Cardiac MRI demonstrated severely reduced right ventricular function with volume and pressure overload consistent with pulmonary hypertension, but no evidence of myocarditis. A CT angiogram showed a prominence of interstitial markings, the main pulmonary artery was enlarged, and the right atrium and ventricle were both severely dilated. A ventilation-perfusion scan demonstrated mismatched perfusion defects along the pleural margins that were interpreted as a high probability of pulmonary emboli.

The patient was started on therapeutic anti-coagulation for possible pulmonary emboli. However, over the ensuing 10 days, the patient's clinical condition worsened despite aggressive therapy for right heart failure that included intravenous diuresis, inotropic support, and pulmonary vasodilator therapy. Given the patient's advanced disease and poor functional status, her protocol treatment was stopped, and she was discharged home with hospice care. She died 1 day later. 

Autopsy showed metastatic carcinoma with lymphangitic spread within the septa and subpleural spaces with associated congestion and fibrosis. Pulmonary arterioles were occluded by organized thrombi, some with evidence of recanalization, as well as smooth muscle proliferation and ingrowth of fibroblasts. Some arteries showed fresh thrombi with metastatic tumor foci. Pulmonary venules were also occluded with ingrowth of fibroblasts. 

Diagnosis:

The patient had metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and developed pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) with features of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD).

Summary:

The patient was admitted for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue. During hospitalization, she was found to have PTTM with features of PVOD, which was a consequence of metastatic cancer. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient worsened and was discharged home with hospice care. She died 1 day later.",How would you simplify the medical description of the patient's diagnosis of pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy with features of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease for easier comprehension by the patient and their family?,"The patient had advanced cervical cancer that spread to the lungs, causing clots within the blood vessels and obstructing blood flow, leading to breathing difficulties and heart failure.

Diagnosis: Genitourinary Malignancy

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the surgery clinic with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia and an enlarging right inguinal hernia with associated discomfort. Physical examination revealed a cystic mass located on the superior right testicle and a firm, solid mass in the right groin. Follow-up CT scan revealed a partially visualized, heterogenous, and enhancing right inguinal mass, raising concern for a peripheral nerve sheath tumor or sarcoma of the spermatic cord. The mass was surgically excised from the spermatic cord and was submitted for pathology evaluation.

Pathology results revealed a heterogeneous pattern-less architecture with alternating hypocellular and hypercellular areas, interstitial hyalinization, and intermixed with ropy collagen bands. The most prominent feature of the tumor was found within the vascular compartment. Numerous small- to medium-sized vessels were present and revealed a continuum of changes, ranging from thick-walled vessels showing proliferation of myocytes, to vessels revealing intimal thickening, and to vessels with circumferential prominent mural hyalinization. Some of the larger vessels displayed subendothelial mucoid degeneration resembling vascular changes observed during accelerated hypertension. Occasional individual exuberant hemangiopericytoma-like vascular channels were also present.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the tumoral cells expressed CD34, BCL-2, and CD99.

This is a hospital course summary for a 63-year-old male patient who presented to the hospital with asymptomatic gross hematuria. The patient was diagnosed with a hypervascular tumor affecting the right kidney, measuring 10 cm in diameter with tumor thrombus towards the inferior vena cava (IVC) - clinical staging T4N1M1.

Treatment:

Initially, the indication of cytoreductive nephrectomy was questionable, and the patient was administered presurgical axitinib treatment. The patient received one-month treatment, which achieved shortened tumor thrombus and shrinkage of the primary site. However, liver invasion progressed, and lung and intramuscular metastases were controllable. The dose of axitinib was increased, but liver infiltration was revealed to be worsening at the two-month follow-up. Therefore, a decision was made to consider immediate surgical intervention with en bloc right nephrectomy and hemihepatectomy.

Perioperative PVE:

Before initiating the scheduled surgery, we performed a preoperative test to determine the liver's health status and estimate the allowed resected liver volume. The indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes (ICGR15) was 5.7%, and the comprehensive evaluation of liver function was Child-Pugh grade A. The estimated resected liver volume was 921 cm3 (71% of the whole liver), and perioperative PVE was performed to preserve residual liver volume and function after right lobectomy (including invaded tumor) in consideration of chemotherapy-induced liver functional deterioration and the high risk of major hepatectomy.

Liver Resection:

The patient was placed in the left hemilateral position, and thoracoabdominal incision was made via the 9th intercostal space, accompanied by an upper abdominal midline incision. The urological surgeons first mobilized the ascending, transverse colon, and duodenum, and the right renal artery was dissected at the interaortocaval region. Intraoperative ultrasound examination revealed that a shortened tumor thrombus remained within the renal vein, and right renal vein dissection. The right hepatic artery and portal vein were ligated and divided after confirmation of tumor invasion into the liver. Liver transection at the midline of the liver was easily achieved under intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion (three sessions at 15-minute intervals) and continuous hemiclamp of the infrahepatic vena cava through the maintenance of central venous pressure at 8 mmHg. After hepatic parenchymal transection exposing vena cava, the right hepatic veins were safely transected using vascular stapler. Finally, urological surgeons performed partial resection with direct closure of vena cava infiltrated by the tumor under good operative view and eventually achieved combined resection of right kidney and right liver.

Outcome:

The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery with no hepatic or urinary complications and has remained free of local recurrence and any de novo metastasis for 18 months. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment was initiated one month after surgery.

Pathological Findings:

The tumor was composed of atypical polygonal cells (Fuhrman grade 2) with clear cytoplasm proliferating mainly in a solid or nested fashion and papillary architecture was also observed in part of the tumor. The pathological findings were compatible with clear cell RCC. The tumor cells infiltrated directly to the renal vein, renal pelvis, right adrenal gland, and the liver. Necrosis was observed in approximately 50% of the tumor with the organization of obstructed medium-sized vessels, suggesting the effect of presurgical treatment. The apparent infiltration of cancer cells to vena cava was not observed.","How can a non-medical professional understand the process described in the discharge summary for a patient with a hypervascular tumor affecting the right kidney, measuring 10 cm in diameter with tumor thrombus towards the inferior vena cava (IVC) - clinical staging T4N1M1?","A non-medical professional can understand that the patient had a large tumor in their right kidney that had spread to the liver and other parts of the body.

The patient presented to our Emergency Department with complaints of pain and swelling over the left antecubital fossa, 6 hours after he had fallen from a rambutan tree. He had ecchymosis over the lateral aspect of his left elbow joint. Radiographs of his left elbow showed chip fracture over the left lateral epicondyle of the humerus. Urgent computed tomography angiogram of his left upper limb was done which revealed a segment of non-opacification of contrast at the distal left brachial artery measuring 3.3 cm with distal reconstitution of the left brachial artery by collaterals just before the bifurcation of the left brachial artery at the left elbow joint. Intravenously administered antibiotics, cefuroxime 750 mg three times a day were given before induction and for 3 days postoperatively.
 
The patient underwent emergency left brachial artery exploration surgery 15 hours after his fall. On intraoperative examination, his distal left brachial artery was contused and therefore, a left brachial-brachial artery bypass was done using reversed saphenous vein graft. Doppler signals of left radial and ulnar arteries had improved postoperatively. The patient did not develop reperfusion syndrome requiring fasciotomy. The vascular repair was successful, and the patient was discharged 4 days after surgery.

Follow-up:
The patient was followed up in orthopedic and vascular out-patient clinics. Six weeks post trauma, his left elbow was noted to be dislocated in an out-patient clinic. Closed manipulative reduction was attempted but unsuccessful. His left elbow was still subluxed. At the last clinic follow-up around 6 months post trauma, his left elbow joint was still subluxed, his left triceps was shortened, and left elbow range of motion was reduced. Functionally, he was able to cope with light duties. He used his left shoulder to compensate for the reduced range of motion of his left elbow. However, he was unable to carry weight > 2 kg using his left upper limb. He was still not keen on any surgical intervention to stabilize his elbow joint due to the risk of vascular graft thrombosis and injury.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Contusion of the distal left brachial artery with left brachial to brachial artery bypass surgery and fracture over left lateral epicondyle and left radial head.

Admitting Diagnosis: Subluxation and intrusion of primary maxillary incisors
Final Diagnosis: Developmental disturbances of the permanent maxillary right central and lateral incisors

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 5-year-old male, was initially admitted to the Centre for the Study and Treatment of Dental Trauma for subluxation of the primary maxillary incisors and partial intrusive luxation of the primary maxillary right lateral incisor. He had been followed up in private dental clinics for 3 years and 5 months prior. The initial clinical examination revealed crown discoloration of both primary maxillary central incisors with pulp necrosis in the primary maxillary left central incisor. Endodontic treatment was performed on the left central incisor. Extraction of primary maxillary right lateral incisor was conducted due to lack of re-eruption. Regular follow-up every 6 months was advised as part of the treatment plan.

Upon subsequent follow-up, developmental disturbances were confirmed on the permanent maxillary right central incisor. Restorative treatment was performed with resin composite for both labial and palatal surfaces for aesthetic reasons. However, absence of eruption of the permanent maxillary right lateral incisor was diagnosed during another follow-up. The cone beam computed tomography revealed the bond between the crowns of maxillary right central and lateral incisors through the enamel bridge. A multidisciplinary treatment plan was outlined involving periodontist, orthodontist and pediatric dentists to expose the teeth through gingivectomy for orthodontic traction.

During the gingivectomy procedure, an attempt was made to display the crown of the maxillary right lateral incisor, and the junction between the crowns of the maxillary right lateral and central incisor was separated using a diamond bur to allow bracket bonding for orthodontic traction. Traction of the lateral incisor was attempted using brackets and later using cantilever systems. However, due to lack of results, another cone beam CT was required, and it was noticed that the enamel bridge between central and right lateral incisors still remained. Hence, periodontal surgery was conducted to obtain a complete separation of the enamel bridge in an effort to allow the eruption of the maxillary right lateral incisor. An indirect facet in composite resin was made to this element.

The patient is currently 16 years old and continues in regular clinical and radiographic follow-up.

In summary, the patient underwent treatment for subluxation and intrusion of primary maxillary incisors at five years of age, leading to developmental disturbances in the permanent maxillary right central and lateral incisors. A multidisciplinary treatment plan was outlined to expose the teeth through gingivectomy and orthodontic traction, which led to eventual periodontal surgery to obtain the complete separation of the enamel bridge.

Medical History:
The patient is a 63-year-old Chinese male who has been undergoing continuous ambulatory PD for the past two years due to end-stage renal failure secondary to reflux nephropathy. He had an episode of PD catheter exit-site infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium species a year ago which was treated with antibiotics.

Admission and Clinical Course:
The patient has been admitted multiple times due to recurrent peritonitis caused by Weeksella virosa and Brevundimonas species. He presented with cloudy peritoneal effluent and mild intermittent colicky right-sided abdominal pain but was afebrile and did not report any vomiting or diarrhea. He was diagnosed with recurrent peritonitis and was treated as an outpatient with intraperitoneal (IP) vancomycin and amikacin initially which was later adjusted to complete a two-week course of IP amikacin. He responded well to the treatment, and the white cell count of the peritoneal effluent normalized within four days.

However, he was readmitted ten days after stopping amikacin for another episode of cloudy peritoneal effluent and abdominal pain. The patient was once again treated with IP amikacin, and his peritoneal effluent white cell count decreased to normal within three days.

Following the completion of the second course of amikacin, the patient was once again admitted for cloudy peritoneal effluent and right-sided colicky abdominal pain. This time he admitted to a breach in the sterile technique, and it was decided to admit him as an inpatient for treatment and investigation of the recurrent peritonitis. The peritoneal effluent culture yielded Dokdonella koreensis that was sensitive to amikacin. He responded to IP amikacin with the peritoneal effluent white cell count normalizing within five days.

The patient was once again admitted three days after completing the third course of IP amikacin for another episode of cloudy peritoneal effluent and abdominal pain. Peritoneal effluent culture again grew Dokdonella koreensis which was sensitive to amikacin. He again responded well to IP amikacin with the peritoneal effluent white cell count normalizing within six days.

The patient was admitted to our department primarily with complaints of hoarseness, dysphagia, and foreign-body sensation, which had gradually worsened over a period of 8 months. The patient was a heavy smoker and consumed alcohol frequently without indulging in alcohol abuse. The patient also had arterial hypertension, which was under control with beta blockers.

After a thorough examination of the head and neck, the patient was found to have a lesion affecting both vocal cords and anterior commissure, with vocal cord mobility being impaired. A cervicothoracic and upper abdomen computed tomography scan was ordered, and the patient underwent direct microlaryngoscopy and biopsy of the lesion under general anesthesia. The biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma affecting the anterior commissure and thyroid cartilage. Imaging also revealed a second lesion approximately 2 cm below the inferior end of the primary one, which was resected along with the primary tumor following informed consent.

The patient underwent total laryngectomy, wide excision of the trachea, and left thyroid lobectomy, followed by bilateral selective neck dissection (Robin’s levels II–IV) and removal of the paratracheal lymph nodes (Robin’s level VI). The surgical resection margins were free of disease. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on day 16 with normal swallow function.

The final pathological report confirmed that the primary tumor was a glottic carcinoma, while the second tumor had morphological features identical to those of the primary one with an upward infiltrating pattern. The lymph nodes from the left neck dissection specimen showed extracapsular spread, as did many of the neoplastic emboli observed in lymphatics between the two tumors.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, patient was made nil per os and started on intravenous hydration. Abdominal ultrasound showed a distended gallbladder (GB) with sludge, thickened GB wall, and positive sonographic Murphy sign, leading to a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated. Intra-operatively, the GB was thickened and firm but not overly distended or perforated. The GB was dissected from the liver edge, and a liver biopsy was performed successfully. The pathology report from the cholecystectomy revealed chronic cholecystitis with amyloid deposits in the GB submucosa and serosa, as well as abnormal plasma cells with lambda light chain restriction. A liver biopsy also exhibited abnormal plasma cells in periportal locations with lambda light chain restriction.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital in the context of progressive weakness of finger extension of the right hand. Initial clinic evaluation showed 0 out of 5 strength in the extension of all fingers, including the thumb. He was diagnosed with posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) entrapment at the arcade of Frohse (AF), after electromyography (EMG), and nerve conduction study (NCV). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a homogeneously hyperintense lesion within the supinator muscle. The lesion measured 3 cm medial to lateral, 1.5 cm in depth, and 3.3 cm anterior-posterior.

The patient underwent a 10-cm incision along the posterior border of the brachioradialis (BCRL) muscle. The fascia in between the brachioradialis (BCRL) and extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) was incised and a plane was developed using blunt dissection. The fascia of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) was divided sharply, and the lipoma was visible, arising deep to the superficial head of the supinator.

The radial nerve bifurcation into the superficial radial nerve and PIN was identified. The AF and the superficial head of the supinator muscle were divided until the lipoma was fully exposed. The PIN was draped across the outer surface of the lipoma and then continued its course deep to the remaining superficial head of the supinator. There was a swelling of the PIN proximal to its compression site by the lipoma and the AF. The PIN nerve fibers appeared slightly spread at the attachment site of the lipoma. The PIN was stimulated with a nerve stimulator probe, and there was no response distally. External neurolysis was conducted, and the PIN was swept laterally for complete excision of the lipoma.

Pathology revealed mature adipose tissue consistent with the lipoma without any nerve fibers. At a four-month follow-up visit, the patient regained 4 out of 5 strength of finger extension in all digits.

Thus, after the successful excision of lipoma, the patient's strength improved. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy team for further rehabilitation and was discharged with follow-up care instructions.

Admitting Diagnosis: Blurred vision in the left eye

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to our facility with a chief complaint of blurred vision in his left eye. His history revealed that he had received intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide for a misdiagnosis of uveitis along with dexamethasone injections, intravitreal injection of conbercept, and laser photocoagulation at another hospital, yet he experienced no improvement. Upon examination, his left eye was found to have non-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multifocal exudative lesions in the posterior pole. Additionally, intraocular TA was discovered in the nasal retina. 

The patient underwent a 50% dose of verteporfin photodynamic therapy under the guidance of indocyanine green angiography. One month later, an ophthalmic B scan revealed reduced bullous retinal detachment, whereas OCT revealed a decrease in subretinal fluid (SRF). Three months after the procedure, ophthalmoscopy and an ophthalmic B scan displayed complete resolution of the exudative retinal detachment, whereas fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed hypofluorescence and indocyanine green angiography revealed hypofluorescence in the lesion area. SRF on the OCT image disappeared, and the macula regained normal anatomy structure. 

Discharge Diagnosis: Resolved exudative retinal detachment and blurred vision in the left eye. 

Discharge Instructions: 

The patient was advised to rest and avoid any strenuous activities. He was instructed to avoid bright light and to observe good eye hygiene. Follow-up appointments with his ophthalmologist were recommended to monitor any changes in his vision.

Follow-up: 

The patient will be followed up in the ophthalmology clinic to assess his vision after a period of six months.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgery unit due to blunt abdominal trauma and presented with abdominal pain, drowsiness, and hypotension due to generalized peritonitis secondary to ileal perforation. He underwent surgery three times, including enterectomy, end-ileostomy with mucous fistula, saline lavage, four drainages, and a laparostomy. Post-operative, the patient suffered from septic shock, along with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

During his stay in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was intubated and under inotropic support with empirical antibiotic therapy. The antibiogram reported the presence of S. putrefaciens, S. cerevisiae, and Candida species susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, third-generation cephalosporins, and fluconazole, and the appearance of A. baumannii susceptible to colistin. After repeating the intervention which involved intra-abdominal negative pressure and changing the kit every two days, the patient showed improvement on the 12th day and was taken off mechanical ventilation without inotropic support and had continuous spontaneous breathing with a functional ileostomy. He was discharged from the ICU after 20 days and then discharged from the surgery unit after 30 days after receiving several doses of antibiotherapy.

Admitting Diagnosis: Heart Failure 
Final Diagnosis: Cardiac Amyloidosis

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted with worsening symptoms of heart failure. A right heart catheterization showed elevated filling pressures and a Fick cardiac index of 1.6 liters/min/m2. A TEE showed severe asymmetric septal hypertrophy suspicious for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, a cardiac MRI was ordered due to low voltage on ECG and diffuse global late gadolinium enhancement of the left ventricular myocardium. The results showed severe left ventricular hypertrophy and diffuse global late gadolinium enhancement, consistent with cardiac amyloidosis. 

An endomyocardial biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. The subtype was likely wild-type ATTR or variant ATTR amyloidosis. The only extracardiac clinical finding suggestive of systemic amyloidosis was carpal tunnel syndrome. Serum and urine electrophoresis did not detect a monoclonal protein, and serum free light chain ratio was low, which significantly lowered the suspicion for AL-amyloidosis. 

Additionally, an incidental left upper lobe mass was found on the cardiac MRI, which was further characterized as adenocarcinoma on further workup. No further differentiation of the subtype of ATTR amyloidosis was pursued due to the poor prognosis of the adenocarcinoma.

The patient was started on intravenous diuretic and inotrope therapy and showed improvement during the hospital stay.

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted with complaints of headache, blurring of vision, dysarthria, and acute left-side hemiplegia and right-sided ptosis. The previous hospital diagnosed the patient with a brain abscess.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission to our hospital, the patient underwent an MRI with intravenous contrast, which revealed a ring enhancement lesion in the right basal ganglia. Brain biopsy was performed, and the pathology slides showed the presence of T. gondii tachyzoite, considered indicative of TE reactivation. Anti Toxoplasma IgG was positive in lab data, and the HIV antibody test was positive by ELISA method, which was confirmed by the Western blot method. The patient's husband was an addict and had passed away a few years ago. The patient underwent six weeks of treatment with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, folinic acid, and dexamethasone to treat the toxoplasmosis, which led to a significant decrease in Anti Toxoplasma IgG. Triple therapy with Anti-HIV drugs (Tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz) was also performed.

Sex: Male 
Medical Record Number: Not mentioned 
Admission Date: Not mentioned 
Discharge Date: Not mentioned 

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the orthodontist office with the primary complaint of not feeling comfortable with the bite and chin projection. The subsequent clinical examination showed a concave facial profile, with a slight maxillary hypoplasia, significant chin projection, upper lip retrusion, and adequate nasolabial angle. Dentally, the patient presented a Class III malocclusion with proclined upper incisors and retroclined lower incisors, edge to edge bite. The panoramic radiograph showed mild different ramus lengths. Skeletally, Class III pattern with mandibular prognathism and macrognathism was observed.

The treatment objectives were to correct the Class III skeletal pattern, to improve the profile, to increase overjet, and to improve facial aesthetics. Considering that the patient's chief concern was his facial esthetics, it was decided to proceed with SFA with mandibular setback followed by fixed appliances to align, level, and stabilize the occlusion. A computed tomography (CT) was taken for the construction of a model of the skull with Proplan CMF. The surgical plan was mandibular setback. The final set-up for the patient was approved with an overcorrection of lower incisors positive torque, ensuring optimal expression of the lower incisors decompensation exploiting the massive RAP after orthognathic surgery. The brackets chosen were Insignia self-ligating (SL) brackets. The selected sequence of wires was CuNiTi 0.014-in, CuNiTi 0.014 x 0.025-in, CuNiTi 0.018 x 0.025-in, TMA 0.019 x 0.025-in, and stainless steel 0.019 x 0.025-in.

In the day of the surgery, immediately before intubation with the help of a fiber optic probe, CuNiTi 0.014-in archwires were placed. After mandibular setback surgery by sagittal osteotomy, under brain activity monitoring, and once suitable rigid fixation and postoperative occlusion were established, ¼ 3.5 oz intermaxillary elastics were applied with Class III vector. After 15 days, 1/8 3.5 oz intermaxillary elastics were used, and the archwires were changed to 0.014 x 0.025-in CuNiTi. One month after surgery 0.018 x 0.025-in CuNiTi archwires were placed, and Class III intermaxillary elastics were continued. Then, 0.019 x 0.025-in TMA arches were placed six weeks later. The orthodontic treatment was completed five months after mandibular setback, showing great improvements in facial profile, Class I occlusion with ideal overjet and overbite.

At the time of discharge, the patient was stable with no complications. The patient was advised for regular follow-ups and evaluation of the treatment's stability. Appropriate instructions regarding oral hygiene and dietary restrictions were provided. Consultation with a dietician and physical exercises for good health were advised. All other necessary information concerning the patient's management was discussed with the family members. The patient was discharged with good general condition and improved facial esthetics.

Admission: 

A 6-month-old male infant was admitted with a persistent fever and a generalized polymorphous rash. Previous medical history was unremarkable. The patient was transferred from a regional hospital with suspected KD.

Hospital course: 

The clinical exam revealed influenced general status, pallor, a polymorphous rash on the limbs and face, bilateral conjunctival hyperemia, right cervical lymphadenopathy, and productive cough. The laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytosis, hypernatremia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated CRP, and ESR. Echocardiography at admission showed good ventricular contractility, diastolic dysfunction, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate dilatation of LAD.

Diagnosis and Treatment: 

The patient was diagnosed with KD. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was initiated at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day for 5 days, accompanied by intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone at 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days and high doses of aspirin at 100 mg/kg/day. Substitution with erythrocyte mass and human albumin was also performed. Clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters improved after initiation of treatment.

Re-hospitalization: 

The patient was re-admitted due to the recurrence of fever and bilateral conjunctival injection after one week from the cessation of IVIG treatment. Echocardiographic re-evaluation revealed an aneurysm of the LAD with internal diameter and a hyperechoic image inside, indicating a possible thrombus. Low-molecular heparin was initiated, and the aspirin dose was reduced. Another IVIG was performed, and intravenous methylprednisolone was re-initiated in a lower dose for about a week. The ESR values started to decrease progressively, and therefore oral methylprednisolone was given.

Discharge: 

The patient continued low-molecular heparin and aspirin for some time. The echocardiographic re-evaluation did not reveal any improvement, and the cardiologist recommended continuation of the low-molecular heparin for six weeks and aspirin for three months. The infant's status generally improved, but the echocardiography underlined a persistent dilation of the left coronary artery with an aneurysmal portion of about 6 mm and a tendency of stenosis below this portion.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 50-year-old lady, presented to the Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital with a complaint of acute abdominal pain. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) demonstrated the presence of bilateral ovarian mature cystic teratomas, with contrast enhancement within the right ovarian cyst suggesting the possibility of malignant transformation. Tumor marker CA-125 was found to be within normal range. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Gross examination showed the right ovary to be cystic with a smooth surface except for an area with blunt pale soft projections and the left ovary was grossly normal. Microscopic examination of the ovary with soft pale projections showed papillary structures with fibrovascular cores which were lined by transitional epithelium exhibiting nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, and increased mitotic activity. There was evidence of invasion of the ovarian stroma by nests of malignant epithelial cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the urothelial carcinoma showed cytoplasmic and membrane positivity for Uroplakin II. A diagnosis of ovarian cystic teratoma with primary invasive urothelial carcinoma was made based on the Pathological Stage Classification by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition.

The patient, a 21-year-old gravida 1 para 0 woman, presented at 20 weeks for a routine anatomy scan that revealed normal fetal anatomy survey. The estimated fetal weight was within the normal range at 26 and 29 weeks. However, at 29 weeks, ultrasound revealed a single umbilical artery raising the suspicion for a pathological process. Fetal echocardiogram at that time was normal. At 31 weeks, the estimated fetal weight was less than the 5th percentile but there was no evidence of fetal distress. An abnormal cerebroplacental ratio was noted at 32 and 33 weeks. At 33 weeks, the amniotic fluid index decreased and the fetal heart tracing showed spontaneous prolonged decelerations. A primary cesarean delivery was performed, and a live male infant was delivered weighing 1395 g with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.

Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with a pathological process related to a thrombosis of one of the umbilical arteries with necrosis of the medial myocytes. This was likely responsible for the small subchorionic placental infarct. The placenta also showed subendothelial fibrin deposition in stem villous blood vessels and chorionic villous hypervascularity leading to a suspicion of a placental insufficiency.

Treatment:

The patient underwent a primary cesarean delivery due to recurrent prolonged fetal decelerations, and her neonate was delivered successfully. The neonate had no signs related to thrombosis at birth. The patient was given thrombophilia profiles that showed a severe protein S deficiency (activity 13%) at birth, which resolved at two months of age (activity 66%).

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 15-year-old female, was admitted for further evaluation after a suspected diagnosis of MRKH (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome). The patient was seen at the clinic prior to age 10 and returned at age 14, reporting menarche at age 14. Free testosterone was high (6.8 pg/mL), and polycystic ovary syndrome was suspected. However, it was discovered that the patient had not menstruated after the medroxyprogesterone challenge test, and a detailed sexual history revealed continued amenorrhea, lower abdominal pain, and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs).

During the examination, no opening to the vagina could be identified, such that the genital swab could not penetrate beyond a wall of pale pink, thin tissue, immediately past labia minora. Further physical examination of the genital tract, or insertion of a speculum, was not possible due to this abnormality. Ultrasound confirmed the lack of a vaginal canal, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a remnant uterus, consistent with a diagnosis of MRKH. In the presumed location of the uterus, there was a longitudinal soft tissue plate measuring 2.5 × 1.4 centimeters. There was also no direct communication to the vulvar region. Bilateral ovaries were identified and demonstrated developed follicles.

MRI also revealed a mildly asymmetric and dysmorphic sacrum and L5 vertebral body. Bilateral kidneys were present in the expected location. The left renal collecting system was duplicated, with mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter, extending to the level of the left common iliac artery. Both ureters on the left side were mildly dilated, down to the crossing of the iliac artery. More distally, the caliber of duplicate ureters was within normal limits. The right kidney was unremarkable but with a slightly prominent ureter.

The patient had noted hearing loss. A pure tone audiometry test demonstrated conductive hearing loss at low frequencies, in the right ear. However, auditory brainstem response testing of the inner ear (cochlea) and brain pathways for hearing were within normal limits.

It was important to note that the patient had a history of psychiatric diagnoses and was receiving pharmacological treatment (clonidine and methylphenidate) and counseling. Socioeconomic and familial challenges likely contributed to development and exacerbation of psychiatric and behavioral issues. In addition to facing poverty, the patient's mother was deaf and partially blind, and the patient served as caretaker.

During the stay at the facility, the patient reported suicidal ideation, but reported major improvements in quality of life after taking residence in a behavioral health rehabilitation facility and maintaining regular psychiatric appointments and medications.

Patient demographics: 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and postprimary coronary intervention in 2011

Chief Complaint: Erythematous skin with severe itching and flaking presented on the entire body surface

Hospital Course Summary:

Upon admission, the patient presented with erythematous skin with severe itching and flaking presented on the entire body surface after taking a single dose of methampyrone orally. The patient had conjunctivitis, turbid corneal in the bilateral eyes, ulceration of the mouth, and swollen lips. He had generalized skin erythema and irregularly shaped itchy purpuric macules. On examination, the epidermal detachment was observed over 30% of BSA and Nikolsky's sign was clearly elicited with a detachment of the epidermis from lower layers when slightly rubbed, and extension of existing bullae to the clear skin indicated an active TEN.

Treatment started with replacement of fluid loss while maintaining electrolyte imbalance and antibiotic therapy. The patient started methylprednisolone 125 mg TID along with cyclosporine 50 mg BID, but after 2 days of hospitalization, his skin lesions did not show any improvement. The patient's skin change progressions rapidly extended from 32% at hospital admission to 62% of BSA involved with 16% in grade I and 46% in grade II hemorrhagic blisters.

Due to the lack of patient's response to initial therapy, TPE was initiated using the COBE Spectra Apheresis System and a double membrane filtration device via central vascular access. The patient's condition rapidly improved after the completion of the first TPE session, with blistering and extensive epidermal necrosis halting after the second and third session of TPE. Rapid reepithelization occurred by 1 week of the introduction of TPE. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home in 8 days of hospitalization with good condition. Proper instructions were given regarding a possible relapse and methampyrone avoidance. At the checkup, the lesions had completely disappeared.

Diagnosis: Erythematous skin with severe itching and flaking presented on the entire body surface due to adverse drug reaction to methampyrone, followed by bullous exfoliation of the skin, and diagnosis of active TEN.

Interventions: Treatment for the patient involved replacement of fluid loss and maintaining electrolyte imbalance and antibiotic therapy. The patient started methylprednisolone 125 mg TID along with cyclosporine 50 mg BID, but due to the lack of response to initial therapy, TPE was initiated. The procedure was performed using the COBE Spectra Apheresis System and a double membrane filtration device via central vascular access. TPE was started on day 3 and provided every 2 days for a total of three procedures.

Outcome: The patient's condition rapidly improved after the completion of the first TPE session, with blistering and extensive epidermal necrosis halting after the second and third session of TPE. Rapid reepithelization occurred by 1 week of the introduction of TPE. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home in 8 days of hospitalization with good condition. At the checkup, the lesions had completely disappeared.

Follow-up: Proper instructions were given regarding a possible relapse and methampyrone avoidance. The patient's primary care physician will continue to monitor the patient's progress and provide necessary follow-up.",Can you provide a simplified explanation of the patient's condition and the treatment given for erythematous skin with severe itching and flaking presented on the entire body surface due to adverse drug reaction to methampyrone followed by bullous exfoliation of the skin resulting in active TEN?,"The patient experienced an adverse drug reaction to Methampyrone which caused erythematous skin with severe itching and flaking and eventually developed into active TEN.

Admitting Diagnosis: N/A
Principal Diagnosis: Mitral valve myxoma

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for evaluation of flank pain radiating to the left lower quadrant of her abdomen due to multiple adjacent obstructing calculi in the mid left ureter causing moderate left-sided hydronephrosis. She underwent left ureteral stent placement with no intraoperative events. Given the history of cardiomyopathy, the patient underwent preoperative cardiac evaluation, which revealed a mitral valve vegetation. Antibiotic therapy was started, and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which revealed a noncalcified mass with uniform echodensity located on the atrial side of P2. This led to a differential diagnosis of myxoma, papillary fibroelastoma, liposarcoma, and an infectious vegetation. Left heart catheterization revealed nonobstructive coronary artery disease and mild mitral regurgitation. The decision was made to perform minimally invasive mitral valve excision and valve repair with P2 resection since the risk of embolization is increased with mitral valve masses greater than 1 cm. Histopathological findings confirmed a 9.0 × 8.0 × 6.0 mm myxoma attached to the external valve leaflet. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by respiratory insufficiency likely related to obstructive sleep apnea, which resolved within a few days following the procedure.

Discharge Diagnosis: Mitral valve myxoma

Discharge Instructions:

This is a discharge summary for a 30-year-old male patient who was admitted to the hospital with fever, non-productive cough, and exertional dyspnoea. On admission, the patient had hypertension and renal impairment, and was diagnosed with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis three months prior to admission. Initial examination showed pancytopaenia and dysplastic hypoproliferative bone marrow, peripheral blood detected cytomegalovirus, and subsequent testing revealed positive anti-CMV IgM. Anti tuberculous therapy was commenced for disseminated tuberculosis, but the response was poor. The patient was later diagnosed with Aspergillus fumigatus on bronchoalveolar lavage wet smear and culture, and began treatment with voriconazole. Unfortunately, the patient developed acute bilateral lower limb ischaemia and underwent emergency embolectomy. Further imaging revealed a large splenic abscess and multiple small focal lesions in capsular and cortical regions, suggestive of fungal embolism, subsequently treated with liposomal amphotericin. The patient underwent elective splenectomy. The patient also showed signs of immune deficiency and impaired T cell proliferation with concanavalin A. 

Hospital Course: 
The patient presented to the hospital with fever, non-productive cough, and exertional dyspnoea. Initial examination showed several underlying medical conditions, including hypertension, renal impairment due to mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis diagnosed three months prior, pancytopaenia, and dysplastic hypoproliferative bone marrow. Peripheral blood detected cytomegalovirus and subsequent testing revealed positive anti-CMV IgM. He was treated with ganciclovir for 21 days and ultimately showed improvement.
Later, the patient was diagnosed with disseminated tuberculosis, but treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide showed poor response. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed Aspergillus fumigatus and treatment with voriconazole was initiated. After six weeks, the patient developed acute bilateral lower limb ischaemia and fungal embolism was detected in the emboli occluding bilateral popliteal arteries. Liposomal amphotericin was commenced for four weeks after which the patient developed acute left upper motor neuron type facial nerve palsy suggestive of fungal embolism. Percutaneous aspiration failed to clear the splenic abscess and the patient underwent splenectomy. The patient also showed signs of immune deficiency and impaired T cell proliferation with concanavalin A.

Hospital Course: 
The patient is a 69-year-old man with type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, end stage renal failure, CMML, dyslipidemia, and obesity. The patient presented to the emergency room with a 3-day history of ongoing macroscopic hematuria. Upon physical examination, the patient was afebrile and his vital signs were within normal limits. He was diagnosed with hemorrhagic cystitis and prescribed ciprofloxacin, which resolved the macroscopic hematuria. However, in September 2017, the patient experienced another episode of macro-hematuria and was prescribed ciprofloxacin again. Despite antibiotics, the patient had symptoms related to UTI and a urine sample for culture was obtained. A multi-drug resistant Myroides odoratimimus strain was isolated from the urine culture. The patient was then treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and the urinary catheter was ultimately removed to decrease the possibility of recurrent UTIs. The patient was found to have a strong biofilm-producing bacteria which contributed to an increase in vivo of its virulence.

Discharge Diagnosis: Hemorrhagic cystitis caused by multi-drug resistant Myroides odoratimimus

The patient, a 75-year-old Caucasian female, presented to the emergency department with progressive dizziness, weakness, early satiety, and chest heaviness. A review of symptoms was negative for abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematochezia, melena, and bone pain. The patient had a remote history of acid reflux disease, history of colonic diverticular disease, and regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Physical examination was notable for pallor, tachycardia, and positive fecal occult blood.

Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin count of 7.6 g/dL, prompting further evaluation for a gastrointestinal (GI) source for the bleeding. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed erosive gastritis and duodenitis as well as a non-obstructing Schatzki ring at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The pathological evaluation of the gastric and duodenal samples was positive for signet ring carcinoma, favoring a presumptive diagnosis of linitus plastica. However, further investigation revealed an invasive lobular carcinoma in the chest wall and peritoneum.

The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells and symptoms improved. She was subsequently started on hormonal therapy with anastrozole, and later on the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, palbociclib.

Given the high suspicion for a breast primary, a full thickness biopsy of the inframammary nodular lesions was attempted. Additionally, the patient underwent abdominal laparoscopy with peritoneal biopsies from the diaphragm, falciform ligament, and lower pelvic peritoneum.

The patient had a medical history of AH, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and chronic atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to airway obstruction during chest X-ray. After being stabilized, the patient was extubated, but the obstruction reoccurred, leading to reintubation. Despite medical interventions, the patient experienced cardiac arrest and subsequent hypoxic ischemic brain damage. The patient remained in a comatose state until their death, which occurred 24 days after admission to the ICU.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, which resulted in recurrent airway obstruction and cardiac arrest. Hereditary angioedema was ruled out due to normal levels of C3, C4, IgE, and C1 esterase inhibitor protein levels.

Treatment:
The patient received standard treatment for angioedema, including epinephrine, methylprednisolone, and clemastine, but these were ineffective due to persistent soft tissue swelling. All previously used medications were discontinued, including the ACE inhibitor. Two units of fresh frozen plasma were administered, but there was no improvement. A diagnostic test was performed to differentiate angioedema, resulting in the identification of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Treatment for angioedema was continued until the angioedema resolved 13 days after the discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient, a 73-year-old female, presented with dyspnea on exertion. Chest radiography revealed an enlarged mediastinal silhouette. Preoperative CT and echocardiography revealed a giant cyst (12 × 10 cm in diameter) occupying a large area around the left atrium and ventricle, and it was present behind the pulmonary artery. Percutaneous cystocentesis was performed, and 800 ml of serous liquid was aspirated. However, 1 week after cystocentesis, the cyst recurred, and its size was the same as that before the procedure. Therefore, resection was planned.

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:

Open surgery through median sternotomy was performed. The cyst was found to be attached to the visceral pericardium involving the left atrium and pulmonary artery. The cyst was most tightly attached to the main pulmonary artery. Thus, it was thought to have originated from the pulmonary artery. The content fluid was aspirated via direct puncture, and the cyst wall was completely dissected with an ultrasonic scalpel. The surgery was successfully completed without CPB.

POSTOPERATIVE COURSE:

The postoperative course was uneventful. CT confirmed absence of cyst recurrence or pericardial effusion. There has been no recurrence of the cyst since discharge (2 years).

The patient, a 46-year-old nulliparous woman, presented with progressively increasing pain in the right side of her groin and labia majora, along with a growing lump. She had previously undergone three laparotomies for ovarian cystectomy. Pathology reports indicated ovarian endometriosis. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy and excision of a 3.7 × 2.5 cm labial mass, which revealed adenomyosis, multiple leiomyomas in the uterus, and endometriotic cysts in both ovaries. The labial mass contained focal atypical endometriosis on a background of benign endometriosis. One month prior to her visit, she had undergone biopsy of the labial mass at a provincial hospital, which showed apocrine hidrocystoma. However, the mass continued to increase in size with progressive pain.

Upon presentation at our hospital, a hard mass measuring 7x4-cm was found at the right labia majora extending to the right groin area. A computed tomography scan revealed an ulcerative mass at the right labia majora and nodal metastasis at the bilateral external iliac and superficial inguinal regions. A biopsy showed a papillary growth structure lined by round tumor cells with clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic nucleoli. The tumor exhibited cytoplasmic staining for napsin A. The diagnosis of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vulva with coexisting atypical endometriosis was made based on these pathological findings.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our clinic with a traumatic work-related patellar tendon rupture from the inferior pole of the patella. The patient had a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II. The patient was initially treated with primary repair, which resulted in progressive quadriceps atrophy, patella alta, and 10 degrees of an extensor lag. The patient was compliant with the standard rehabilitation protocol and had no history of traumatic reinjury. The patient underwent revision patellar tendon repair with the goal of returning to work at some capacity and resuming his normal activities of daily living.

Emergency Department Course:
N/A

Consultations:
N/A

Diagnostic Studies:
The patient had a T2-weighted MRI and lateral knee radiograph at 11-month follow-up that confirmed patella alta deformity, an intact albeit lax patellar tendon, and cartilage fissuring near the inferior patellar apex. His preoperative patient-reported outcome scores were reported.

Hospital Course and Procedures:
The previous midline incision was dissected to visualize and confirm obvious redundancy and thinning of the patellar tendon. A rectangular block of redundant patellar tendon tissue was outlined and resected to correct the degree of patella alta. The patella was mobilized using blunt dissection. The suture material from the index repair was removed, and the distal patellar footprint was prepared. Two anchors were anchored 2 cm apart on the distal patellar footprint. Krackow sutures were passed through the midsubstance of the patellar tendon, and with the opposite limb of each stitch, a half hitch was made such that a pulley mechanism was created. The tendon was reapproximated, and final fixation was secured with four mattress anchor knots with five alternating half hitches. The wound was closed with a standard layered closure. Postoperative lateral knee radiograph displayed that patella alta had been corrected. At 18-month follow-up, the patient had a repeat MRI performed which demonstrated that patella alta had been corrected.

Health Maintenance:
The patient was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and regular exercise. No specific medications or treatments were advised or prescribed.

Duration of Hospitalization: [Redacted]

Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with bilateral adrenal nodules resulting in cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma, also known as Cushing's Syndrome (CS). Additionally, she was diagnosed with Kappa light chain Multiple Myeloma (MM) of stage I.

Hospital Course:

The patient complained of progressively worsening back and arm pain over 2 weeks. She came to the hospital with a medical history of occasional use of Chinese herbs and weight loss pills. She had a non-severe falling accident, which led to worsening back and right arm pain. Clinical examination revealed a rounded face, truncal obesity, purplish striae, and high blood pressure. Hypercortisolism was suspected.

The provisional diagnosis of ECS was confirmed by a 24-hour urine cortisol level, serum cortisol levels after dexamethasone suppression, and loss of physiologic diurnal variation. ACTH-independent CS was determined by an ACTH level. CT of the upper abdomen showed bilateral adrenal nodules. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) revealed a predominantly left-sided ratio of adrenal venous to peripheral plasma cortisol. The patient also had a compression fracture of the T5-T10 vertebrae and osteolytic lesions in her ribs and pelvic bones, which resulted in the suspicion of metastatic cancers and MM.

Further diagnostic investigations revealed Kappa light chain MM, International Staging System stage I. The patient was prioritized for MM treatment using the bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCD) regimen. The treatment was recycled every 28 days with a total of six cycles, after which a very good partial response was achieved. An autologous stem cell transplant was performed.

Five months after the stem cell transplant, the patient underwent left laparoscopic adrenalectomy, where a left adrenal cortical adenoma was identified. She received a steroid replacement, which was gradually discontinued over 9 months. Her blood pressure decreased slowly, and she was successfully tapered off the anti-hypertensive drugs over 2 months. Her Cushingoid appearance gradually subsided, and she was in remission of both diseases after more than 30 months of treatment.

Outcome:

The patient was discharged upon achieving remission. She had a complete response to the intervention and was doing well at the time of discharge. Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor her progress.

Final Diagnosis:

Cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma
Multiple Myeloma of stage I. 

Treatment:

The patient was treated with the bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCD) regimen and underwent autologous stem cell transplant. She then underwent left laparoscopic adrenalectomy.

PRESENTATION AND COURSE OF CARE:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and referred to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon due to intense pain in the left facial area after facial nerve reconstruction during plastic surgery. Initially, the patient was diagnosed with painful traumatic trigeminal neuropathy and treated with Trileptal, which was later switched to Neurontin. The patient received 25 U of Innotox injection into the left masseter along with physical therapy using Sellalux. After the first injection, the patient's pain reduced significantly, but persisted in the lower left eye and zygoma area. A second injection was performed six months later, which considerably alleviated the pain in the patient's left facial region. A third injection was administered 3 months after the second dose of the Innotox. Thereafter, the patient's pain was markedly reduced to a manageable level.

Hospital Course:
A 45-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital with swelling and bone exposure of the left buccal region. She had previously undergone excisional biopsy twice, which led to the same diagnosis of osteoma. Computed tomography (CT) showed a diffuse radiopaque lesion around the maxillary alveolar cortical bone surface spanning from the first molar to the second molar. Biopsy demonstrated features of necrotic bone without atypia. The exposed region recovered after the biopsy without any additional treatment. However, bone exposure was noticed again in the same region after a year and the swelling enlarged over time. Two debulking surgeries including biopsy were performed in the following years, but these biopsies did not demonstrate features of malignancy. CT showed a diffuse bone mass accompanied by radiolucent areas, which arose from the surface of maxillary alveolar bone and invaded into the pterygopalatine fossa. Histopathological assessment showed a stromal component consisting of dense atypical spindle cell proliferation and focal cartilage formation with mild atypia. Immunohistochemical staining showed diffuse expression of β-catenin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in atypical spindle cells. These cells were also stained by runt-related gene 2 (RUNX-2), special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2), or sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9), indicating that these cells were derived from cells that had the ability to differentiate into osteoblastic cells and cartilage cells. Moreover, co-expression of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) along with a dedifferentiated subtype of high-grade sarcoma was seen. She was diagnosed with stage IIB dedifferentiated parosteal osteosarcoma (DPOS) based on the Enneking staging system.

The condition was treated by wide resection and chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was performed consisting of pirarubicin (THP-ADM) and ifosfamide (IFO). Although slight shrinking of the tumor was observed in radiological examination after three cycles of chemotherapy, the majority of the tumor did not demonstrate any other changes. Subsequently, subtotal maxillectomy was performed using a combined transcranial approach with orbitozygomatic osteotomy and transcervical approach with mandibulectomy. The surgical specimen was examined histopathologically. Although a decrease in cell density and tumor degeneration due to NAC were observed in the high-grade component, the number of tumor cells in the low-grade component remained viable. Therefore, the chemotherapy effect was considered to be grade 1 based on the Huvos grading system. Based on the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy in DPOS treatment, additional chemotherapy using cisplatin (CDDP) + THP-ADM was administered. The post-treatment progress was good, and no severe functional morbidity, such as eating dysfunction or dysphonia, was observed. Her General Oral Health Assessment Indices (GOHAI) were 59 and 53 points before operation and a year after surgery, respectively. She has shown no indication of recurrence after 15 months.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Stage IIB dedifferentiated parosteal osteosarcoma

The patient, a 3-year-old female, was referred to a tertiary metabolic bone disease unit for premature loss of primary teeth with roots intact and low serum ALP activity. Routine genetic testing revealed compound heterozygosity for different TNSALP missense mutations in exon 5 of the ALPL gene, confirming the diagnosis of HPP. Radiologic assessment of the left hand and arm showed tongue-like lucencies projecting into the metaphyses consistent with childhood HPP. The patient did not have any clinical features of skeletal involvement of the lower limbs and no motor developmental delay except for a mild waddling gait as a younger child.

At age 11 years, the patient presented swelling and tenderness of the left ankle that was nonresponsive to paracetamol or ibuprofen. An MRI scan of the ankle suggested a diagnosis of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, which was subsequently confirmed by biopsy. The symptoms of pain and swelling of the lower limb joints showed spontaneous transient improvement at age 13 years. Recurring at age 14 years, the symptoms fluctuated and caused significant pain and disability. These symptoms eventually stabilized when the patient transitioned to adult care at age 17 years.

At age 18 years, the patient successfully underwent radiofrequency ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, a cardiac disorder unrelated to HPP. The patient is now 27 years of age and has experienced an episode of metatarsal stress fracture; she also suffers from generalized aches and pain. Over 22 years, the patient was hospitalized 3 times for a total of 19 days. Only 1 hospitalization exceeded 3 days, when the patient was admitted for 14 days to receive intravenous antibiotics for suspected osteomyelitis.

This is a hospital course summary for a 68-year-old Japanese woman who was admitted for treatment of recurrent tumor deposits in the pelvic cavity, consistent with peritoneal dissemination and vaginal metastasis. The patient previously underwent ileocecal resection with lymph node dissection due to appendiceal cancer, which was confirmed as KRAS-mutant (codon 12) moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient had undergone multiple courses of chemotherapy and surgical resection, the latest of which was performed to remove a tumor attached to the external iliac artery, external iliac vein, ileum, and right obturator lymph nodes. However, the patient developed liver metastasis, para-aortic lymph node metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination, which were considered unresectable. The patient subsequently received palliative care and passed away one and a half years after the last surgery.

Admission summary:

The patient was admitted to our hospital with a history of recurrent tumor deposits in the pelvic cavity, consistent with peritoneal dissemination and vaginal metastasis. The patient had undergone previous surgical resection and chemotherapy for KRAS-mutant moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the appendix. The patient was admitted under the care of the oncology team for further management.

Hospital course:

During the hospital stay, the patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent surgical resection for tumor control and increased resectability. A femoro-femoral arterial bypass with a synthetic vascular graft was performed to secure the blood supply to the right lower extremities. The subsequent laparotomy revealed a fixed and solid tumor at the right inguinal fossa, involving the external iliac artery, external iliac vein, ileum, and right obturator lymph nodes. En bloc tumor resection was successfully performed, including a partial resection of the external iliac artery, external iliac vein, and ileum. The postoperative course was uneventful, except for a prolonged ileus.

Postoperative management:

The patient received FOLFIRI as adjuvant chemotherapy following the tumor resection. After six courses, a follow-up CT scan showed liver metastasis, para-aortic lymph node metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination. These recurrent lesions were considered unresectable. The chemotherapy regimen was altered to trifluridine/tipiracil. After seven courses, a follow-up CT scan showed a significant progression of the liver metastasis. Regorafenib was then administered for two weeks; however, it was discontinued because the patient denied further aggressive treatment.

Patient: 47-year-old male

Chief Complaint: Sudden epigastric pain with vital signs indicating shock.

History of Presenting Illness: The patient presented to our hospital with sudden epigastric pain. One month earlier, the patient was hospitalized in our department and underwent omental patch repair for gastric ulcer perforation. Emergent contrast-enhanced CT revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma in the pancreatic head, aneurysm formation in the PDA, and extraluminal compression to the celiac trunk. Extravasation was also detected around the aneurysm in the PDA, but no liquid was retained in the peritoneal cavity. IVR therapy was performed for retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the ruptured PDA aneurysm. PDA coil embolization was performed for IVR hemostasis. Subsequent SMA arteriography showed several collaterals other than embolized PDA perfusing the proper hepatic artery. Obstruction of the duodenal passage resulting from the hematoma was observed for a few weeks; however, bypass surgery was not required as the obstruction was completely relieved as the hematoma was naturally and gradually absorbed.

Hospital Course: After observation and assessment, the patient underwent incision of the MAL to release extraluminal compression of the CA. The surgery was performed 3 months following IVR hemostasis. The laparotomy was performed with a midline abdominal incision, and the wall adhesion to the abdominal organs was peeled off, the lesser omentum incised, and the aortic fissure of the diaphragm exposed. In addition, the MAL on the anterior surface of the CA forming the aortic fissure was incised after taping the left and common hepatic arteries, respectively. The abdomen was closed after confirming that anterograde blood flow from the CA was restored with intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography. The patient was discharged 8 days after the surgery with no complications. Follow-up CT 6 months after the surgery confirmed the absence of stenosis in the CA with no de novo aneurysms.

Diagnosis: Retroperitoneal hematoma in the pancreatic head, aneurysm formation in the PDA, and extraluminal compression to the celiac trunk.

Treatment: Emergent contrast-enhanced CT, IVR therapy, PDA coil embolization, incision of the MAL to release extraluminal compression of the CA, and observation.

Reason for Admission: Multiple food allergies and anaphylaxis

Brief Hospital Course:
MS is a 10-year-old female with multiple food allergies and a family history of atopy. She was diagnosed with milk, peanut, and tree nut allergies at the age of 5 based on clinical history, skin prick testing, serum-specific IgE testing, and oral food challenge (OFC). Additionally, she has dust mite and pet allergies. A pediatric EAI (EpiPen Jr®; 0.15 mg) was prescribed to her in case of an allergic emergency at an early age. MS has had three allergic emergencies requiring the use of her EAI, and her STBD was measured during these visits. At 6 years old, her STBD was 10.7 mm, and at 9 years old, her STBD was 12.1 mm. When she was 7 years old, she complained of pain immediately in her right thigh after using her EAI. X-ray and ultrasound results were negative. It was discovered that she may have suffered an unintentional bone injection when using her EAI, which was reported to Health Canada.

Recommendations:
MS and her parents were informed that usage of the prescribed EAI could cause unintentional injection in the bone during a standard injection technique due to compression. To avoid full compression, it was suggested that the vastus lateralis muscle be squeezed prior to injection. MS and her parents were advised to follow this protocol to prevent future bone injections.

The patient was admitted to our neurosurgery department after suffering a fall from three meters' height while climbing a tree. He landed head down on his left frontotemporal region against a rock, immediately losing consciousness and displaying severe blurring of vision and pain over his left eye when he regained consciousness five minutes later. He remained unconscious until being brought to the hospital six hours after the accident. 

Upon admission, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15, with left eye traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) and a grade II relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) noted. Ocular movement restrictions and periorbital ecchymosis with severe chemosis over the left eye were also present. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain and orbit revealed multiple fractures in the left frontotemporoparietal bone and greater wing of sphenoid, with a bony spur abutting and impinging the left lateral rectus and optic nerve.

The patient underwent a left craniotomy, elevation of the depressed frontotemporoparietal skull fracture, and evacuation of blood clots 12 hours post-injury. Intraoperatively, it was discovered that the bony impingement was relieved once the depressed skull fracture was elevated, precluding the need for further orbital exploration. Post-operative results were good. The patient's visual acuity improved within two days to 6/6 for both eyes; the RAPD was absent.

He had previously been treated for dengue fever at a local hospital and had made a full recovery. However, five days after discharge, he began to experience weakness in his right hand, which subsequently progressed over time. He presented with an inability to write or button his shirt due to the weakness of his hands. The patient also reported mild weakness in both feet that did not significantly interfere with walking. He did not present with any accompanying numbness, parasthesia or pain.

On general examination, the patient had an average build with no pallor, lymphadenopathy, or signs of malnutrition. The patient showcased some small muscle wasting of bilateral hands and feet. The patient had diminished power asymmetrically graded as 3 out of 5 in the right hand and 4 out of 5 in the left hand. Additionally, all fine finger movements were affected along with some degree of weakness in wrist extension. The patient showcased diminished power grade 4 in distal lower limbs (feet). Bilateral foot dorsiflexion was weak, while ankle jerks were elicited with reinforcement. Knee jerks were elicited without reinforcement and there was no objective sensory impairment of touch, pain, temperature, vibration, and joint position sensations in both upper and lower limbs. No cerebellar signs were demonstrated and his gait showed a minimal degree of high-stepping due to weak dorsiflexion. 

Blood tests revealed white blood cell count: 8.5 × 109/L, platelet count: 274 × 109/L, hemoglobin 12 g/dl with normal red cell indices. The blood picture showed normochromic normocytic cells with some reactive lymphocytes suggestive of a recent viral infection.

History and Physical Examination:
The patient had a medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol, and a surgical history of a right inguinal hernia repair. The patient presented with symptoms of abdominal fullness and nausea for the past 2 months. Physical examination and laboratory findings were within normal limits.

Diagnostic Studies:
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a well-demarcated oval isodensity mass measuring 25 mm at the tip of his appendix. Contrast-enhanced CT showed that the lesion had gradual homogeneous contrast enhancement from the arterial phase to the equilibrium phase. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) revealed a well-demarcated hypoechoic tumour with a size of 22 mm × 18 mm × 18 mm, with some cystic areas and blood flow. Colonoscopy findings were normal.

Management and Treatment:
Preoperative diagnosis indicated appendiceal neuroendocrine tumour (NET) G1 or gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumours such as GIST. Malignancy could not be ruled out, therefore laparoscopic ileocecal resection with D3 lymph node dissection was recommended. Intraoperative findings revealed a well-demarcated tumour at the tip of the appendix, with no invasion into the surrounding tissue. According to another intraoperative finding, dissecting the adhesion between the terminal ileum and the peritoneum, which was the effect of the past herniorrhaphy, was necessary. The operation was successful with a total operation time of 167 minutes and blood loss of 100 ml.

Pathology:
Pathological findings revealed a well-demarcated tumour originating in the muscular layer at the tip of the appendix. Spindle-shaped heterotypic cells proliferated in a bundle. Vascular invasion and lymph duct invasion were not observed. No tumour cells were found in the dissected lymph node. Immunohistochemical studies revealed S-100 protein positive value but negative values for KIT and CD34 which confirmed the schwannoma of the appendix.

HOSPITAL COURSE
The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of central scotoma and distortion in the right eye for two months. Dilated fundus examination revealed multiple, well-demarcated zonal areas of outer retinal atrophy in both eyes with pigmented brownish dots located mainly at the margins of the atrophic areas but also within the lesions bilaterally. Fluorescein angiography (FAF) in both eyes revealed a trizonal pattern and a demarcating hyper-FAF line between the involved and uninvolved retina, suggestive of AZOOR. After two months, a progression of the zonal lesions was found in both eyes, and in the right eye, a subfoveal type 2 CNV developed. Over a course of 3 years, the patient underwent intravitreal anti-VEGF injections on a treat-and-extend regimen (12 ranibizumab and 5 aflibercept injections), and her vision stabilized. During treatment, a zonal progression was noted at the right macula, while the lesion at the posterior pole of the left eye remained stable with fovea sparing. The patient remained asymptomatic with a BCVA of 20/20 in the left eye.

Admission Diagnosis: Hypercalcemia with possible metabolic bone disease and suspected primary hyperparathyroidism.

Hospital Course:

The patient presented to the medicine clinic with heel and lower back pain. Initial investigations revealed mildly elevated calcium levels and lytic lesions in the right iliac bone. The patient was lost to follow-up for several years until her bone pains resurfaced. Further workup revealed hypercalcemia, elevated PTH levels, and metabolic bone disease. A parathyroid adenoma was suspected based on ultrasound and sestamibi scan findings. A DXA scan revealed severe osteoporosis, with an increased risk of fractures.

Surgical intervention was required, and the patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy and inferior parathyroidectomy with level six lymph node resection. Histopathology confirmed a diagnosis of parathyroid cancer.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced hypocalcemia, which was managed with a slow infusion of calcium supplementation. She was discharged on oral calcium and vitamin D supplements with active vitamin D (calcitriol). Follow-up revealed improved bone mineral density and normal calcium and PTH levels.

Patient is a 38-year-old female who was admitted to our hospital with blackish discoloration and ulceration on her right big toe and left fourth toe. She had a previous diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) with Raynaud's phenomenon and was on treatment for two years before presenting to us. She had no previous systemic complaints, and her DAS-28 was within the remission range.

On examination, there was mild pallor, but no joint deformity, jaundice, or rash. Peripheral pulses were palpable in all limbs, but there was reduced blood flow in left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries with reduced peak systolic velocities on Doppler ultrasound. The patient's platelet count was persistently elevated, prompting further work-up that revealed a positive JAK2 V617 mutation and histological findings suggestive of Essential Thrombocytosis on bone marrow trephine biopsy.

Following confirmation of the revised diagnosis, treatment was modified to include Aspirin 75 mg and Hydroxyurea 1 gram per day in addition to her RA treatment. The patient responded well to the treatment with regards to clinical and laboratory parameters. However, she developed gangrene of the toe, leading to the amputation of the distal phalanx of the toe and nail excision. Anagrelide was started after a surge in her platelet counts, and the patient is on regular follow-up visits.

Overall, this was a challenging case of Rheumatoid Arthritis with associated Essential Thrombocytosis that required close monitoring and timely intervention. The patient's clinical course was complicated by the development of gangrene, for which appropriate measures were taken. The patient remains under observation, and her response to the revised treatment plan has been favorable so far.","How would you rephrase the sentence ""The patient's clinical course was complicated by the development of gangrene, for which appropriate measures were taken."" in simpler language for a patient-facing report?",The patient had a serious problem with her toe that led to the amputation of part of it.

Patient: 28-year-old Thai male with a history of E-beta-thalassemia and splenectomy.

Admission Date: [date]
Discharge Date: [date]

Admission Diagnosis:
- Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH)
- Spinal cord compression
- Anemia

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient presented with a 3-month history of tightness in his bilateral flank region, weakness, difficulty walking requiring crutches, and unintentional 10-pound weight loss due to poor appetite, all of which progressed over time. The patient had a history of E-beta-thalassemia and splenectomy, but had stopped following up with his hematologist 8 years prior, reporting a baseline hemoglobin of 6 g/dL. On examination, the patient had bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness, slow broad-based gait with ambulation, decreased light touch sensation of the thorax at the level T7-T10, at left medial thigh, and in bilateral lower extremities below the knees. An MRI of the brain showed masses involving the clivus and medial occipital bone with mass extension into the bilateral maxillary/sphenoid sinuses, posterior aspect of ethmoid cells, bilateral maxillary bones, inferolateral orbits, and parietal calvarium. An MRI of the thoracic/lumbar spine showed significant stenosis, and the masses were found to be extramedullary hematopoietic elements. The patient was started on a PRBC transfusion to gradually increase baseline hemoglobin to above 10 g/dL along with hydroxyurea 15 mg/kg/day. Hydroxyurea was gradually increased to 2000 mg daily to achieve maximum possible hematopoiesis suppression. The patient regained gross sensation in his lower extremities 2 days after the initiation of treatment. After 1 week of hospitalization, gait had improved, and gross sensation of the thoracic area had returned. The patient subsequently graduated from physical therapy. By hospitalization day-14 when he was discharged, the patient had received a total of 6 units of PRBC. Hydroxyurea was maintained at 2000 mg daily without causing neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. An MRI of the thoracic/lumbar spine repeated 2 weeks after the initial imaging showed significant reduction in mass effect on spinal cord and decreased spinal canal stenosis. After discharge, he was maintained on hydroxyurea 2000 mg daily with blood transfusion to maintain hemoglobin above 10 g/dL.

Final Diagnosis:
- Mild chronic appendicitis
- Strangulated small bowel obstruction caused by a vitelline vascular remnant

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of right lower abdominal pain and vomiting. Physical examination revealed deep tenderness at McBurney’s point without abdominal distension. Laboratory tests showed slight leukocytosis without an elevation of the C-reactive protein level. Enhanced computed tomography scan showed slightly enhanced, thickened appendiceal wall, and inflammatory changes were evident due to appendicitis. Initial diagnosis was mild acute appendicitis based on the physical examination, blood test, and imaging results, and laparoscopic surgery was performed to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

During the laparoscopic surgery, a strangulated small bowel obstruction caused by trapping of ileal bowel loops by a band was observed. After reduction, the band was found to be connecting the right medial umbilical fold to the ileal mesentery, and it was resected using laparoscopic coagulation shears. The band was connected to the ileal mesentery, and neither Meckel’s diverticulum nor ischemic change of the trapped ileum was detected. Appendectomy was also performed as the appendix showed slight inflammatory changes. The patient was discharged without complications on postoperative day 4.

Pathological examination revealed that the band consisted of blood vessels, and it was diagnosed as a vitelline vascular remnant. Furthermore, fecal stones were found on the proximal side of the appendix, and the wall was slightly thickened. Pathological examination revealed diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils throughout the muscularis propria, and the patient was diagnosed with mild chronic appendicitis.

Follow-Up Care:
The patient was advised to follow a healthy diet and gradually resume normal activities after discharge. They were given a prescription for pain relief medication and advised to follow up with their primary care physician in 2 weeks for further evaluation.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 72-year-old female with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), was admitted to the hospital due to symptoms of heart failure. The patient underwent a left classic BTS operation at the Tokyo Women's Medical College in the 1950s when she was 10 years old and stopped visiting the hospital postoperatively due to lack of difficulty performing daily activities. The patient presented with dyspnea and leg edema and was diagnosed with heart failure at a local clinic. After being referred to our hospital, the patient was found to have symptoms consistent with the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III. Subsequently, hemodynamic assessments were performed, and laboratory data were collected, which showed elevated creatinine levels and serum brain-type natriuretic peptide levels. The chest radiograph revealed a cardiothoracic ratio of 66%, right-sided aortic arch, and a prominently dilated pulmonary artery (PA) without pulmonary congestion. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a prolonged PR interval and ST-T segment abnormalities. The echocardiogram showed a large ventricular septal defect with a mainly left-to-right shunt overriding the aorta, right ventricular hypertrophy, and a stenotic right ventricular outflow tract. Further imaging showed a reduced right ventricular ejection fraction and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. The catheter angiogram revealed a patent BTS and severe stenosis at the ostium of the left PA. Right heart catheterization showed normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure, mildly elevated pulmonary artery pressure, elevated right ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular pressure. Cardiac output was calculated by the Fick principle, and pulmonary vascular resistance index was calculated. The patient was then started on diuretics and home oxygen inspiration therapies, and the symptom of heart failure improved to NYHA II. 

Summary of Care:
The patient, a 72-year-old female with TOF and a history of left classic BTS operation, was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of heart failure. She was diagnosed with a large ventricular septal defect with a principally left-to-right shunt, overriding the aorta, right ventricular hypertrophy, and a stenotic right ventricular outflow tract. Moreover, subsequent tests, including echocardiogram, imaging, and catheter angiogram, showed that the patient had a patent BTS and severe stenosis at the ostium of the left PA. The patient was started on diuretics and home oxygen inspiration therapies, which significantly improved her heart failure symptom. Based on clinical and hemodynamic assessments and her age, it was decided not to perform radical operation. 

Discharge Condition:
The patient was discharged from our hospital under stable condition with improved heart failure symptoms and was advised to continue taking diuretics and home oxygen inspiration therapies. The discharge summary and follow-up instructions were given to the patient and her family. 

Follow-Up Instructions:
The patient is advised to take the prescribed medications as directed and attend follow-up appointments with her primary care physician. The patient should monitor for any worsening heart failure symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if any symptoms occur. Moreover, the patient is advised to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction. Medication reconciliation should be conducted as appropriate.

The patient underwent phacoemulsification, intraocular lens implantation, pars plana vitrectomy, ILM peeling, and sulfur hexafluoride tamponade for an epiretinal membrane and lamellar macular hole (MH) repair in January 2016. However, macular hole retinal detachment occurred one month after the surgery. She underwent additional surgeries for a successful retina attachment but with worsening refractory MH leading to unsatisfactory outcomes in several follow-up surgeries in 2017. Due to repeated surgeries, an autologous free ILM flap could not be harvested. Therefore, a neurosensory retinal free flap transplantation was performed in April 2018, which resulted in a closure of the MH. 

Discharge Summary:

The patient's medical records show a 68-year-old female who underwent several surgeries due to complications from an epiretinal membrane and lamellar MH. We updated her condition and treatment throughout her hospital stay, culminating in a successful neurosensory retinal free flap transplantation in April 2018 that resulted in the closure of the MH. She was instructed to maintain a prone position for 14 days postoperatively and to avoid any unnecessary movement. The patient had reported an improvement of visual acuity and a decrease in scotoma area. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved from 20/500 preoperatively to 20/50 at 2 months postoperatively.

Admission Diagnosis: Suspected cocaine intoxication

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 30-year-old Brazilian male, was brought to our emergency department from a local jail due to agitation and suspected internal concealment of drugs of abuse. An abdominal CT scan confirmed the presence of cocaine-containing body packets. Upon admission, the patient presented with psychomotor agitation, mydriasis, and tachycardia. Communication with the patient was not possible due to his altered mental status and foreign language. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia without signs of ischemia. The physical examination of the heart, lungs, and abdomen revealed no pathologies. A CT scan showed packets in the gastrointestinal tract without signs of gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation. The laboratory tests revealed an increased C-reactive protein (CRP) level, an increased creatinine level, an increased creatine kinase (CK) level, a slightly increased troponin level, hypoglycemia, mild hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia.
Due to the patient's condition, we suspected infection rather than massive cocaine intoxication as the main problem. A thoracic CT scan revealed rapidly progressive pulmonary infiltrates, nodular pulmonary consolidations, diffuse lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. We initiated broad-spectrum antibacterial treatment with ceftriaxone and clarithromycin. Given the rapid progression of the pulmonary infiltrates, we also considered the possibility of toxic rather than infectious infiltrates. We added piperacillin/tazobactam to the antibacterial treatment as for sepsis with the unknown focus. Acute kidney injury diagnosed, most commonly caused by dehydration precipitated by infection and cocaine intoxication. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids.
Upon further diagnostics, pneumococcal urinary antigen test was positive. Screening and confirmatory tests for HIV-1 were positive, and CD4+ T-cell count was 144/μl, so we diagnosed CDC stage A3 HIV infection. Blood, and urine cultures didn’t show bacterial growth. Active pulmonary tuberculosis was excluded by three negative sputum smears and three negative sputum cultures. With the aid of an interpreter, the patient reported that one of the drug packages had ruptured in his mouth during swallowing, but that he had been able to spit out most of the cocaine.
The patient recovered uneventfully after 9 days of hospitalization and was discharged into custody of the Swiss authorities. Antiretroviral therapy was established in an outpatient setting after ruling out active pulmonary tuberculosis.

Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Suspected cocaine intoxication
2. Pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis with unknown focus

Patient Name: Mr C
Age: 60s
Sex: Male
Admission Date: [not provided]
Discharge Date: [not provided]

Hospital Course:

Mr C was admitted for psychological therapy due to symptoms of PTSD he developed after serving in the UK military police during the Northern Ireland peacekeeping operations in the 1960s. At the time of admission, he reported experiencing intrusive fragmented images of a trauma memory in his right peripheral field of vision, which he had been avoiding for years. He also reported experiencing fluctuating mood states that included detachment, overwhelming anxiety symptoms when confronted by a reminder of the event, and depression. Mr C had previously used alcohol to cope with his symptoms.

During his admission, Mr C was found to be avoidant in engaging in TF-CBT. He utilized several therapy sessions to discuss his concerns and attempted to use multiple grounding strategies in the therapy room. However, he either presented as matter of fact and detached from any emotion or was unable to tolerate 'in vivo' reliving of his trauma memory that involved closing his eyes and felt overwhelmed by physical panic symptoms leading to dissociation.

Mr C's PTSD symptoms were maintained as he avoided confronting his trauma memory. He did not gain access to his peri-traumatic cognitions in both reliving sessions.

Outcome:

Mr C was discharged after completing his psychological therapy. He was provided with some coping strategies that could help him manage his PTSD symptoms in case they re-emerged. No further medical intervention was recommended at the time of discharge.

Prognosis:

Prognosis for Mr C is considered fair. However, it is likely that his PTSD symptoms will return if he avoids confronting his trauma memory. It is recommended that he continues to practice coping strategies to manage his PTSD symptoms. Follow-up sessions were not recommended.",How can Mr C's avoidance of confronting his trauma memory be restated in different words?,"Mr C demonstrated resistance to engaging in TF-CBT as he struggled to tolerate reliving his traumatic memory, resulting in him avoiding confronting the memory altogether.",Paraphrasing

Patient Name: Mr P
Gender: Male
Age: 40s
Medical Record Number: [redacted]

Admission Date: [redacted]
Discharge Date: [redacted]
Duration of Stay: [redacted]

Medical History:
Mr P is a former UK army member who was deployed to Bosnia during the mid-1990s conflict. He was exposed to a morgue containing multiple bodies in different states of decomposition which has led to the development of PTSD symptoms. He reported experiencing intrusive memories and nightmares that caused him high levels of anxiety and triggered dissociative symptoms causing him to feel emotionally detached from people around him.

Hospital Course:
Mr P was reluctant to talk about his traumatic experiences in detail and was not able to identify the underlying cause for his avoidance symptoms. He attempted to use physical objects as grounding strategies but needed to avoid any emotions related to his past experiences. This made it difficult for him to engage in traditional methods of therapy.

Treatment:
An adaptive approach was then employed to address hindering factors. This involved walking Mr P through the imaginal scene outdoors to address dissociation, viewing the imaginal scene from multiple perspectives to facilitate contextualization of the memory and finally identifying and reappraising the cognitions with frequently used approaches in trauma-focused therapy.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr P has made good progress in therapy with the adaptive approach employed to address dissociation and fragmentation of traumatic memories. He is advised to continue with therapy on an ongoing basis and to follow up with his therapist for further treatment. Mr P is advised to manage any future symptoms using adaptive coping strategies such as meditation or exercise.

The patient, a 9-year-old boy, was admitted to our hospital with a history of recurrent neck abscesses since the age of eight. He had received antibiotics and had undergone drainage of the abscesses in other hospitals. Upon admission, Barium esophagography showed a Pharyngocutaneous Fistula (PSF) on the left side, and oral contrast coronal computed tomography (CT) showed an air- and barium-containing fistula.

The patient underwent open neck surgery for definitive treatment of the PSF and quickly recovered. However, two weeks later, he visited our hospital again because of another neck abscess. Barium esophagography revealed fistula recurrence at the same location. The patient underwent Minimally Invasive Surgery (MLS) because reoperation with the cervical approach was expected to be difficult. Although the fistula was wider and deeper than expected after resection of the fragile layer associated with inflammation, the entire mucosal remnant was macroscopically removed, and the procedure was completed uneventfully.

On the seventh postoperative day, a follow-up Barium esophagography was performed, and no issues were noted. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged ten days after the surgery. There were no observed recurrence or complications during an 18-month follow-up.

Medical History: N/A

Admission Reason:
The patient was admitted to our center following a road traffic accident that caused multiple significant injuries, including unstable pelvic fractures and femoral fractures. The patient also had bilateral pneumothoraces, extensive pulmonary contusion, and a splenic hemorrhage.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient was resuscitated using local major hemorrhage protocols and receiving ten units of packed red cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma. To stabilize his condition, he underwent an emergency laparotomy and splenectomy. Due to respiratory distress, the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) from day 15 of his admission for 21 days. On day 21, he underwent an emergency thoracotomy to address a massive haemothorax. The patient was subsequently stepped down to the general intensive care unit on day 36 and was transferred to the ward on day 55 to continue his prolonged rehabilitation and recovery period.

Course of Liver Function:
The patient experienced a modest change in liver function tests during his hospital stay. ALP increased from 55 to 143 IU/L between day 1 and day 6 of hospital admission. Proceeding decannulation, there was a sequential increase in ALP peaking at 2335 IU/L on day 113. The ALT also rose to a lesser extent, peaking at 781 IU/L on day 52. The bilirubin did not rise above 57 μmol/L. Autoantibody screen, immunoglobulins, and viral hepatitis serology were negative.

Diagnostic Imaging:
Serial ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging were performed to exclude biliary stones and sludge. The liver on CT at day 1 showed normal liver and biliary structure, and it was not until 10 months after the admission, the repeat magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated a multistenotic pattern of disease within the intrahepatic ducts.

Treatment Plan:
In the absence of significant casts within the biliary tree and no evidence to suggest biliary sepsis, ERCP was not deemed helpful. The patient was given a conservative management approach, and he was instigated on ursodeoxycholic acid to help improve cholestasis. The patient was closely monitored as an outpatient upon discharge for progressive liver disease and dysfunction. Repeat imaging and noninvasive fibrosis assessments were undertaken.

Outcome:
Despite having evidence of SSC, the synthetic liver function has remained excellent, cholestasis markers have improved, and there have been no episodes of cholangitis or biliary sepsis for over 1 year.

Hospital Course:
During the course of the hospital stay, the patient underwent several diagnostic tests including MRI of the spine, high-resolution CT chest, and 18F-FDG PET scanning. The imaging tests revealed diffuse nodular and linear leptomeningeal enhancement along the spinal cord and cauda equina, bilateral hilar adenopathy, and multifocal, nodular FDG-avid uptake in the mediastinum, hila, liver, and spinal canal, respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing showed moderate reactive pleocytosis with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 3.56, protein 3.99 g/L, and glucose 1.7 mmol/L.

Diagnosis:
Based on clinical symptoms, test results, and biopsy findings from a liver lesion, the patient was diagnosed with systemic sarcoidosis with probable neurosarcoidosis affecting the spinal cord.

Treatment:
The patient was initially treated with pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone followed by high-dose oral steroids with slow wean. Azathioprine was also started as a steroid-sparing agent. The patient responded well to the treatment, with normalization of power and sensation. However, he experienced several relapses during the steroid wean and had difficulty managing his blood glucose on glucocorticoids.

Medical History:
- Smoking history

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our facility due to sudden lower abdominal pain. Although the pain subsided half a day later, he experienced abdominal bloating and nausea that gradually worsened. Physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness and a pulsatile, fist-size mass under the umbilicus. Upper endoscopy showed severe edematous stenosis of the duodenum. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated severe stenosis at the origin of the celiac artery caused by the midline arcuate ligament, as well as a low-density retroperitoneal mass lesion and dilatation of the branches of the pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA).

The diagnosis was duodenal stenosis caused by a retroperitoneal hematoma secondary to rupture of the PDA aneurysm. Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms are uncommon and are typically attributed to occlusion or constriction of the celiac artery caused by the median arcuate ligament, arteriosclerosis, or fibromuscular hyperplasia. The patient underwent midline arcuate ligamentotomy to improve the stenosis at celiac artery, thereby decreasing hematoma and clearing duodenal obstruction. It was hypothesized that elevated pressure of the PDA resulted in formation and subsequent rupture of an aneurysm into the retroperitoneum, producing the hematoma.

The patient responded well to treatment and was subsequently discharged. Post-treatment plans included follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's overall health and ensure that the condition did not recur.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our department with a complaint of pain in the left posterior mandible, associated with periodontal hyperplasia of the left mandibular second molar. The patient had also been experiencing ongoing pain for two months and spontaneous hemorrhage within the lesion region. On examination, the patient showed no visible swelling, tenderness, or pus discharge, but intraoral examination showed hyperplasic gingival tissue around the second molar. The panoramic radiograph showed irregular margins located at the periapical area, which led to a serious mobility of the mandibular left second molar.

After conducting a thorough clinical and radiographical examination, an incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia, which led to the diagnosis of peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG). A second surgery was performed under local anesthesia one week later, involving extraction of the tooth and a wide curettage of the lesion in the left posterior mandible. Pathological assessment of the second biopsy revealed a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Further investigations were done, and it was revealed that the patient potentially had DLBCL in other anatomical sites, such as the thyroid gland, gastric system, and prostate.

The patient was relieved and healing was uneventful. However, several consultations and investigations were undertaken. Whole body PET/CT scan was conducted, and based on the results, the patient underwent systemic chemotherapy as further treatment protocol of DLBCL.

Patient: 10-year-old boy with widespread heterotopic ossification

Hospital course:

The patient was admitted to our outpatient department with complains of multiple bony hard swellings in the back and both the arms since the last eight years. The patient had undergone surgery of a swelling in his proximal arm previously, but the swelling recurred and restriction in movements persisted. Gradually, multiple swellings appeared over bilateral infrascapular regions, and the shoulder movements became restricted with time leading to severe limitation of his activities of daily living. The patient had difficulty in feeding himself along with an inability to dress and undress at the time of presentation.

On examination, bony hard swellings were present over bilateral parascapular and infrascapular regions extending up to the lower dorsal spine, which severely restricted all the shoulder movements bilaterally. Non-tender bony hard swellings were present in both the arms primarily on medial and posterior aspects, which were associated with fixed flexion deformity of 90° at both the elbow joints with a further 10° flexion movement possible. There was a severe restriction of the neck flexion and extension movements, while the hip movements were also severely restricted on both sides. The patient also had hallux valgus present bilaterally along with microdactyly of the great toes.

Diagnostic findings:

On plain radiographs, heterotopic ossification was seen in the soft tissues around humerus on both sides, extending through the axilla to the chest wall, along left side of the neck on radiograph of cervical spine, as well as the pelvis with bilateral hips. Bony outgrowth like appearance due to ossification along ligamentous insertion on right lateral distal femoral metaphyses as well as bilateral proximal medial tibial metaphyses producing pseudoexostoses were revealed on the radiographs of both the knees. Bilateral hallux valgus with monophalangism of the great toes was found in the radiographs of both feet.

Diagnosis:

Based on the presence of congenital bilateral great toe anomalies and progressive widespread heterotopic ossification in the characteristic anatomic pattern, a clinical diagnosis of FOP was arrived at.

Plan:

The patient’s relatives were counselled about the prognosis and lack of definite treatment and cure for the disease. They were also informed about the presence of support groups like International Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva Association (IFOPA) to advocate, support and connect patients, and their families, afflicted with this debilitating disorder.
